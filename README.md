## Contributing

Want to do code-seva on behalf of InnovAnon, Inc. (Ministries)? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/InnovAnon-Inc.github.io/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/InnovAnon-Inc.github.io/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

Minimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your site's unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask. 

This goes for author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- I have no intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get you started :smile:.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `my-awesome-new-feature`).
