This is a high level overview of the life of a practitioner.

## Birth
Birth is not a particularly special event in canon:
the Covenant of Abraham is rejected,
official membership is not granted until
a sort of [rumspringa]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) is performed,
and formal baptism does not occur until
an [advanced]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/siddhi.md %}) stage
of spiritual development is attained.

## Baptism
A symbolic celebration, marking a rebirth.
The official time for baptism is upon the attainment of Eternal Life,
and again at the attainment of Level 4 [Ascension]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}),
but mini-baptisms may be performed at each
level of [initiation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/government.md %}),
and at a few points during the Neophyte Studies,
as well as at any other time.

Full submersion for a good while really makes it count.

## Ascension
Daily rituals as well as
regular [congregations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %})
help to attain Eternal Life,
and begin the process of Ascension to Salvation.

Few people reach this level of attainment,
and the ones who do are often
not long for this world,
so as to avoid relapsing into a lower level of Ascension:
perhaps this baptism should be by fire.

## Death
In the moments preceding the time of death,
a practitioner who has attained Eternal Life
performs the [Ultimate Rite]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %}).

If any death rites are performed,
they involve open air cremation,
as with burial at sea or the Hindu style,
accompanied by the customary skull-bashing.

The lack of death rites is not an undesirable fate,
as with taking a final solitary pilgrimage to the Garden of Eden.

Efforts at preserving the body after death are considered heretical.
Personal belongings may also be burned at this time.
