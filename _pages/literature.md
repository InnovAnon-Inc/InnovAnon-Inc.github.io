In our ministry, Adepts and Priests are acknowledged for their [prophetic abilities]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}), which enable them to receive divine inspiration and insights. As a result, a Priest has the authority to declare their own writings, as well as the writings of others, as canonical.

Canonized writings hold a position of higher authority and influence within our ministry, superseding older writings that may have undergone alterations over time.

By recognizing and embracing this prophetic nature of our clergy, we ensure that our literature remains dynamic and ever-evolving, reflecting the divine revelations and truths that continuously unfold within our ministry.

Through this approach, we create a living, ever-expanding library of spiritual wisdom that inspires and guides our members on their individual paths of enlightenment.
