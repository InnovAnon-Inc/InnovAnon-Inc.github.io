Priests are autonomous agents.
If they choose to work together for whatever reason,
then their acting figurehead is the High Priest.

The High Priest may declare an [order of succession]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %}) for his position.
The Priests may challenge that order of succession.

A Priest may grant to an Adept the title of Priest at his discretion.
A Priest may also confer to an Adept a Doctorate of Divinity
in the Practical Application of the Divine Sciences.

There are two [ways]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %})
to prove your status as an Adept:
- The Trial of the Adept
- The Right of the First Priest

An Adept may declare himself a Priest and establish his own Priesthood.
That priesthood is recognized as legitimate.
