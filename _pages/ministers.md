Priests are autonomous agents.
If they choose to work together for whatever reason,
then their acting figurehead is the High Priest.

The High Priest may declare an [order of succession]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %}) for his position.
The Priests may challenge that order of succession.

A Priest may grant to an Adept the title of Priest at his discretion.
A Priest may also confer to an Adept a Doctorate of Divinity
in the Practical Application of the Divine Sciences.

There are two [ways]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %})
to prove your status as an Adept:
- The Trial of the Adept
- The Right of the First Priest

An Adept may declare himself a Priest and establish his own Priesthood.
That priesthood is recognized as legitimate.

The rule we propose for the organization aims to make it more robust against fracturing and catastrophic scenarios, such as the extinction of leadership or situations where the priest's credentials and reputation may not precede them in missionary scenarios.

By claiming to have a rigorous process for testing and influencing the occurrence of supernatural or otherwise non-probable phenomena, our priesthood aims to establish credibility and authority. Witnesses who have observed these supposed miracles and attested to their uncanniness and inexplicability are presumed to automatically accept any priest's spiritual insights based on the fact that they are a properly vetted priest.

This proposed rule serves to ensure that the spiritual insights and authority of the priesthood are recognized and respected by both the organization's members and those outside of it, even in the absence of direct knowledge or familiarity with a specific priest's credentials.

The title of Minister in our organization is bestowed upon individuals who have proven themselves to be adept in spiritual matters. There are specific requirements for becoming a Minister listed on the "Government" page, and this status indicates that our ministry recognizes them as authorities in their respective areas of expertise. As Ministers, they have the ability to assert their own teachings and interpretations as canon. We acknowledge and accept that contradictions may arise among the teachings of different Ministers, and we encourage individuals to congregate under the guidance of a Priest whose canon aligns with their beliefs and culture. Our organization aims to support and connect Ministers with shared interests or projects. Donors are encouraged to contribute funds and resources to specific Ministers or to the organization itself, and we are committed to providing transparency through real-time ministry accounts and asset publications. This allows auditors and donors to make informed decisions, and it enables us to demonstrate the legitimate allocation of funds towards our ministry's purposes.
