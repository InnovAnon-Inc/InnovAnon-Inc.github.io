Priests are autonomous agents.
If they choose to work together for whatever reason,
then their acting figurehead is the High Priest.

The High Priest may declare an [order of succession]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %}) for his position.
The Priests may challenge that order of succession.

A Priest may grant to an Adept the title of Priest at his discretion.
A Priest may also confer to an Adept a Doctorate of Divinity
in the Practical Application of the Divine Sciences.

### The Trial of the Adept
To [qualify]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) for the status of Adept,
a person must perform a miracle before a quorum of Adepts who will verify its authenticity.
This status is irrevocable.

### The Rite of the First Priest
In the absence of such a quorum,
the Adept should demonstrate his ability before a congregation of the highest-level initiates he can assemble.

An Adept may declare himself a Priest and establish his own Priesthood.
That priesthood is recognized as legitimate.
