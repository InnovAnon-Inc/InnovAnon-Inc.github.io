## Organization

Priests are autonomous agents. If they choose to work together for whatever reason, then their acting figurehead is the High Priest.

To qualify for the status of Adept, a person must perform a miracle before a quorum of Adepts who will verify its authenticity. This status is irrevocable.

A Priest may grant to an Adept the title of Priest at his discretion.

An Adept may declare himself a Priest and establish his own Priesthood. That priesthood is recognized as legitimate.
