## Organization

Priests are autonomous agents. If they choose to work together for whatever reason, then their acting figurehead is the High Priest.
The High Priest may declare an order of succession for his position.
The Priests may challenge that order of succession.

To qualify for the status of Adept, a person must perform a miracle before a quorum of Adepts who will verify its authenticity. This status is irrevocable.
In the absence of such a quorum, the Adept should demonstrate his ability before a congregation of the highest-level initiates he can assemble.

A Priest may grant to an Adept the title of Priest at his discretion.

An Adept may declare himself a Priest and establish his own Priesthood.
That priesthood is recognized as legitimate.
