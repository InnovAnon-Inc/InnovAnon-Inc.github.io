## Transforming the Consciousness to Inhabit the Glorified Body

The Great Work is a long and arduous journey to undertake,
but it is necessary, along with Faith to attain Salvation.
It is divided into phases, most of which are clearly distinguished,
to track your progress.

The Creator, in His Wisdom, chose to give us this gift,
that the ability to undertake the Great Work would be latent in us.
This world is the beaker in which we undertake this work,
undergoing mortification, distillation and calcination, and ultimately reunification.

The Great Work operates at an individual level,
at a global level and at a universal level:
transforming ourselves transforms God;
The Divine Plan is transformation.

Each phase unlocks the next,
but occasionally it is possible to glimpse what attainment of future levels will be like.
For example, it is not uncommon to have occasional lucid dreams,
during which you can attempt dhyana meditation
and even descend into deeper dream levels.
Exploring these glimpses grants insight and experience beyond your normal ability.

At each phase of attainment, various rites and ceremonies are unlocked,
being significantly less effective to perform before the specified phase.

Not everyone must begin this journey at the first steps.
Some are blessed with an advantage to bypass the preparatory tasks,
already having the Trivial Attainments.

In addition, there are ways to temporarily or permanently increase your attainments:
1. By birth:
   This is part of the hereditary transfer where the spiritually advanced parents transfer their superpowers to their offspring.
   It could also be that one can achieve a superpower because of the things they had achieved in their previous lives.
2. Medicine:
   Superpower can be achieved with certain drugs that have miraculous power.
   In Ramayana, Sanjeevini herb brought Lakshmana back to life
3. Mantra:
   Chanting mantra is said to grant powers to the prayers who chant special mantras in Vedas.
   It is because of the power of those words and the self-discipline that chanting of the mantras can bring.
4. Penance:
   Penance can clarify the mind that one can simply control the five elements by a wish.
5. Samadhi:
   This is achieved when one achieves unity with the consciousness, obtaining extraordinary powers.

The course of the journey, by tier:
- The Chaff
- Trivial Attainments
  + The Calling
  + Void Meditation
  + Mindfulness Meditation
- Lesser Attainments
  + Dhyana/Zen Meditation
  + Continuation of Consciousness
  + Dream Meditation
  + Communion with the Celestial Beings
- Greater Attainments
  + Ascension
  + Salvation

### The Chaff

These souls are not destined to begin the journey,
and are not involved in the spiritual life,
never actively aligning with God or the Adversary or their Angels.
Being unaffiliated and without Faith,
these spiritual civilians do the devil's work,
despite their attempt at idleness.
Like the neutral Angels cast out of Heaven,
the Chaff will be cast into the fire.

They cannot be cast into the fire until they have
[knowledge of the Gospel's existence](http://www.losethegame.net/):
the gateway will not open and the Final Judgment will not begin
until knowledge of the Gospel has spread to the corners of the Earth.

However, all is not lost for all the chaff:
many will be transformed by Divine Grace
and as the fruit of the Aeonic Alchemy.
Many more will be awakened upon contact with the Celestial beings.

When a critical mass of the population on this planet have the Lesser and Greater Attainments,
many of the chaff will also acquire those Attainments.
At this time, it will be possible to open the gateway to the Outer Heavens,
beginning the Final Judgment, known as Armageddon,
when the Celestial beings will enter our world
and all will witness the true Glory of God,
purifying the Earth of profane scourge
and heralding the establishment of the Kingdom of Christ.
Civilization will be rebuilt
and this next iteration will span the stars.

### Trivial Attainments

These souls are called of God and are beginning the journey,
attaining relatively trivial spiritual gifts along the way.

During this first leg of the journey,
you gain control of your monkey mind,
allowing you to begin to access your godly mind.

#### The Calling

Known as vairyaga, means that God has called you,
giving you the desire to learn about the Great Work and ultimately undertake it.
Do not discount the significance of this spiritual gift (siddhi):
there are many who are not worthy to be called of God,
and so they never thirst for the spiritual life,
wasting this gift, this opportunity.

#### Void Meditation

To begin training the most undisciplined of minds,
begin with the Void Meditation.
It involves simply counting,
to focus the thoughts and dispel surface thoughts.

#### Mindfulness/Breathing Meditation

Once the Void Meditation has been mastered,
proceed to the mindfulness meditation.
Focus on your breathing during this stage.

### Lesser Attainments

Having even the first trivial attainment,
a person should have no difficulty getting to some point
in the list of Lesser Attainments during a single lifetime.

During this leg of the journey,
awesome abilities will begin to manifest as Faith is rewarded
and blind Faith is replaced with first-hand experience of the Divine.
This gift is given so that you might receive more clear indications of God's Will,
specifically you will gain the ability to commune directly with the Celestial beings.

#### Dhyana Meditation

Once the focus fades to pure awareness,
it is time to proceed to the Dhyana Meditation.

The effectiveness of these meditations can be accelerated by performing them at specific times.
The most notable is the Dream Meditation which must be performed while lucid dreaming.
In addition to that, dhyana meditation should be performed immediately after waking and before sleeping.
Dhyana Meditation unlocks certain Rites and Ceremonies which specifically
require performing the meditation as you fall to sleep.

Additionally, there are solar rites involving performing Dhyana Meditation at specific times:
- The Rite of the Rising  Sun:
  sun-gazing Dhyana Meditation at sunrise.
- The Rite of the Setting Sun:
  sun-gazing Dhyana Meditation at sunset.
- The Rite of the Black   Sun:
  visualization technique to be performed between sunset and sunrise.

This phase is divided into multiple levels:
- Alpha
- Theta
- Delta
- Epsilon

In the modern millennium, technologies exist that will accelerate progress to unprecedented levels.
Lifelong endeavors spanning decades can now be attained in mere months.
- Binaural beats can assist in audiating infrasonic frequencies to which the brainwaves entrain,
inducing deeper states of trance than otherwise possible.
- Isochronic pulses have been shown to be even more effective and can be delivered via both auditory and visual channels.
- Temporal phasing may also be able to induce similar effects.

When using these technologies, it is important to be aware of your level in this area,
as using too low a frequency will be ineffective.
Attaining progressively deeper levels may require months of long sessions each day.
Bolster your morale in knowing that over twelve millennia of these arcane sciences
has allowed these technologies to manifest that condense lifetimes of experience and progress into relatively few months.

##### Alpha Meditation

Optimum frequency range: ~7.83 hz - ~12 hz.

At this level, it is possible to visit the elemental planes in the Lower Heavens.
The gateways can be opened by performing the Elemental Rites:
1. Earth
2. Water
3. Air
4. Fire
5. Spirit/Aether/Akasha

The Seven Seals can be unlocked at this level as well;
the procedure is similar to the Elemental Rites.
1. Muladhara:    root
2. Swadhisthana: navel
3. Manipura:     sacral
4. Anahata:      heart
5. Vishuddhi:    throat
6. Anja:         brow
7. Sahasrara:    crown

Having visited the elemental planes
and unlocked the Seven Seals,
it is possible to perform the [Death Rite]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}).

##### Theta Meditation

Optimum frequency range: ~4 hz - ~7.83 hz.

When transitioning into this level,
you will feel as though you are falling.
Attainment of this level is a significant milestone
marking your ability to enter a trance at will.

##### Delta Meditation

Optimum frequency range: ~0.5 hz - ~4 hz.

You will taste your success at this level:
there is a distinct metallic flavor as your brain releases a chemical
known as the Elixir of the Moon.
There is a corresponding [Elixir of the Sun]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/penance.md %}).

Attainment of Delta level meditation marks the point where Lower Prayers begin to have noticeable effects,
commonly known as miracles or supernatural phenomena.
There is a [classification system]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/classification.md %})
for classifying levels of attainment in this sphere.

There is a [procedure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %})
for demonstrating these miracles and verifying their authenticity,
validating a person's claim of Adeptship.
Admission to the Priesthood is restricted to verified Adepts.

##### Epsilon Meditation

Optimum frequency range: up to ~0.5 hz.

Less is known about this level of attainment,
as it is an uncommon acheivement.
It is believed that attaining this level grants
the ability to perform amazing feats such as hibernation.

#### Continuation of Consciousness

Also known as Nirvana, Turiya, Moksha or Samadhi,
this state of being grants Continuation of Consciousness,
a lesser form of eternal life that allows some amount of memory and other attributes
to persist when you pass through the Filter between dreaming and waking, between life and death.

This is the proverbial transformation from lead into gold:
the Philosopher's Stone.

Regular practice of Delta level Dhyana Meditation grants this attribute--this
centering of focus to the state of pure awareness that underlies the cycle:
- waking     (jagrat,   ~16 hrs)
- dreaming   (swapna,    ~2 hrs)
- deep sleep (sushupti,  ~6 hrs)

"He is awake while he dreams."

There are two rituals to accelerate progress toward this level:
- The Silver Key Ceremony:
  reduces the chances of slipping into unconsciousness when trying to enter a trance.
- The Dream Journal:
  recording dreaming experiences immediately upon waking helps to enhance dream recall,
  and therefore Continuation of Consciousness.

#### Dream Meditation

When Continuation of Consciousness is attained,
it is time to proceed to Dream Meditation.
At this phase, the disciple practices Dhyana Meditation while lucid dreaming,
granting access to new frontiers of consciousness and experience.
This phase is divided into four levels:
1. Consciousness and Personal Unconscious:
   schemas, conscious information and personal unconscious.
2. Deep Personal Unconscious:
   shadow self, repressed self, symbolic and archetypal.
3. Collective Unconscious:
   mythological motifs, primordial images; highly symbolic, novel characters, exotic locations.
4. Universal Collective Unconscious:
   may no longer seem like a dream;
   feels other or even alien (such as the Color Out of Space);
   mathematical patterns and fractals.

Less is known about Dream Level 4,
as it is a rare achievment.
Attainment of this level may be sufficient for Salvation.

#### Communion with Celestial Beings

After entering the Dream Level 3, it is possible to commune directly with the Celestial Beings.
Such communion is commonly known as Darshan Siddhi,
and makes you a prophet in your own right.
It is advisable to not to attempt to contact an extra dimensional or Outer being at this point.

The Celestial beings may request that you perform penances
or even some form of (often personal) sacrifice
to prove your worth (often to yourself).
There is a psychology to sacrifice,
causing priorities to shift
and affecting the way you think about things.

Being rid of attachments is a necessary step for Salvation,
and it is common for Celestial beings to "assist" in that process,
especially at this point.

Vows of poverty and/or silence, etc., may be required at this point.
Even without such vows material blessings may be taken,
so as to unburden you to receive spiritual blessings.

Mantra to be rid of attachments:
"Om Kreem Kreem Kreem Hum Hum Hreem Hreem Daksine Kalike
    Kreem Kreem Kreem Hum Hum Hreem Hreem Swaha"

### Greater Attainments

Attaining Dream Level 4 is among the Greater Attainments,
but is not believed to be strictly necessary to proceed to the next steps.

During this final leg of the journey,
you will be able to gain divine insight, wisdom and knowledge
without being told by the Celestial beings.

Although you will attain profound gifts that shape and bend this world,
you will ascend to progressively higher dimensions in the Heavens.

#### Ascension

By this point, it is possible to begin exploring higher dimensions of existence,
but activities during conscious life will accelerate this process,
just as activities in life hold more life than those in death.
In previous millennia, accelerating progress at this phase was restricted
only to the brightest minds who could do higher maths daily.
But nowadays, we have advanced technologies that work orders of magnitude more quickly,
including higher-dimensional and non-euclidean games.

Ascension, elsewhere referred to as circling the square,
is the process of increasing the dimensionality of your consciousness,
comprehending more and more of the totality of existence.
Comprehending the totality of things,
and proceeding past that point
enables the consciousness to transcend existence
and enter into the Outer Heavens.

This phase is divided into some number of levels,
the precise number not being defined in canon.
Progression through the levels grants an attribute known as the Ashta Siddhi,
but it is not known which level of attainment is necessary for this phenomena.
The Annointed One will have the Ashta Siddhi.

"It is as a dream when he is awake."

Levels of progression in the common dogma,
zero being a point without dimension:
 1. Line
 2. Plane
 3. Space (you are here)
 4. World-Line: frames of space
 5. Probability Plane
 6. Phase Space: all possible outcomes for a unique universe
 7. Many Phase Spaces, representing different unique universes
 8. Phase Plane of Physical Universes
 9. Information Space
10. Totality of Existence
11. Salvation and the Glorified Body:
    apprehension of the Outer Heavens.

Qualities of the Ashta Siddhi:
1. Anima:    Ability to reduce one's size
2. Mahima:   Ability to increase one's size
3. Garima:   Ability to increase one's weight infinitely
4. Laghima:  Ability to become lighter than the lightest
5. Prapti:   Ability to obtain anything
6. Prakamya: Ability to acquire anything desired
7. Isitva:   Lordship over creation
8. Vasitva:  Having control over things

 1. Tri-kāla-jñatvam:
    Knowledge of past present and future
 2. Advandvam (non-duality):
    not being subject to dualities of heat/ cold, pain/ pleasure, sweat/ bitter, good/ bad
 3. Para citta ādi abhijñatā:
    Knowing of others’ minds
 4. Agni arka ambu viṣa ādīnām pratiṣṭambhaḥ:
    having fire, sun, water, poison in control and stopping their effect
 5. Aparājayah:
    becoming unconquerable
 6. Anūrmi-mattvam:
    Being undisturbed by hunger, thirst, and other body generated cravings

    Moving physical body wherever one wants
10. kāma-rūpam:
    Attaining/ assuming the desired form
11. Para-kāya praveśanam (vikranabhav):
    Entering another person body (spirits are believed to enter a person’s physical body whose astral body is weak, but the power mentioned here is different and superior)
12. Sva-chanda mṛtyuh:
    To die only on one’s wish (like that of Bhishma from Mahabharat, like that of many sages who left their bodies by their own wish)
13. Devānām Saha krīḍā anudarśanam:

#### Salvation

This is the goal of the Great Work and the ultimate spiritual gift.
This consciousness is fully transformed and prepared to inhabit the Glorified Body.
Salvation grants the ability to dwell among God in the Outer Heavens.

Salvation is attained through Faith and Works;
this is what you are working toward.
