This spiritual gift, known as Darshan Siddhi,
can be attained by [transforming]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
the consciousness and by completing the prescribed
courses of [study]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %})
in the Divine Sciences.

The [Priesthood]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}) acts as an intermediary,
interceding on your behalf
and transmitting orders from on high
until your progress is sufficient
for you to interact directly with the Celestial beings
and develop a personal relationship with them.

This ability is sufficient for miracles such as prophecy,
and allows you to directly find out the reason why any prayers
might be failing to produce the expected/desired results.
Therefore, people with this gift have the authority to pass dogmas into canon,
and qualify for the Priesthood.

Having attained this ability,
it is now possible to [commune]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %}) with the Mirror Self.
