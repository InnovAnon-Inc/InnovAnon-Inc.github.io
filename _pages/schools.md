## Schools for the Preparation of our Ministers

There are not-for-profit equestrian camps operated by third-party affiliates
in the Garden of Eden where a person may attain the level of Acolyte
and perform the steps necessary for higher levels of initiation.
Attendance at these camps is optional but encouraged.
