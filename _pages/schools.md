At InnovAnon, Inc., we recognize the importance of providing comprehensive education and training for individuals aspiring to become ministers. For this purpose, we have established schools and partnered with not-for-profit equestrian camps operated by third-party affiliates in the Garden of Eden.

These schools and camps offer a unique opportunity for individuals to embark on a transformative journey and [attain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) the level of Acolyte. Through dedicated study, practical experiences, and initiation processes, participants can progress towards higher levels of [ministerial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}) initiation and spiritual growth.

While attendance at these schools and camps is optional, it is highly encouraged for individuals seeking a deeper understanding of our teachings and practices. The immersive and supportive environment of these educational institutions allows for an intensive and focused exploration of the Divine Sciences and the practical application of spiritual principles.

Participants at these schools can expect to engage in a variety of activities, including:

- Embracing World Religions: Attaining empathy and understanding by studying and connecting with different religious traditions around the world.
- Acolyte Studies in Applied Aeonic Alchemy: Embarking on a pilgrimage to the Garden of Eden, participating in winter camps, and spending time on the trail to gain firsthand experience and develop self-sufficiency.

Other studies are addressed in our spiritual Apprenticeship program, including:
- Studying the Divine Sciences: Learning about alchemy, cosmology, and celestial beings to deepen one's understanding of spiritual transformation and the mysteries of the universe.
- Apprentice Studies in Applied Spiritual Technology: Optional study for Acolytes who wish to expedite their progress and dispel delusions that hinder their spiritual growth. This apprenticeship involves one-on-one instruction from a Master and personal insights that have not yet passed into canon.
- Higher Levels of Initiation: The schools and camps provide the necessary steps, guidance, and rituals for individuals to progress to higher levels of ministerial initiation, as outlined in our [Ministers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}) page.

The schools and camps operate as not-for-profit entities, reflecting our commitment to making spiritual education and training accessible to all who seek it. They offer a nurturing and supportive community where participants can learn, grow, and forge connections with like-minded individuals on their spiritual journey.

We strongly encourage individuals aspiring to become ministers within InnovAnon, Inc. to take advantage of these educational opportunities. By attending these schools and camps, individuals can deepen their knowledge, develop their spiritual gifts, and prepare themselves for a meaningful and impactful ministry.
