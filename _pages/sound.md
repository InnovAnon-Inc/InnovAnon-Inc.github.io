The Great Work is an ancient technology,
being the eternal life-way given to Adam;
the rites and ceremonies carry it out
and demonstrate your progress in it.

The regular congregational services,
including the unified prayer,
combine the efforts of solitary practitioners,
contributing to the Great Work.

Many of these rituals involve
opening gateways to realms that
cannot be reached directly from our own.
However, consciousness rests on the cusp
between our world and the ones beyond.

The Human Programming Technologies
are a subset of the Applied Spiritual Technologies,
and relate to manipulating the consciousness.

These technologies help transition into
the necessary states of consciousness
for opening the gateways,
bringing into the modern era
the Great Work, this stone age technology.

Sound (or Light), or more specifically, waves,
is the fundamental nature of existence.
Consciousness is a wave;
existence is the product of consciousness.
This is the wisdom of the Divine Sciences--this
sort of code that underlies all things.

Like an in-game item, created by leveraging the game's code,
these technologies apply that wisdom,
rapidly transitioning the consciousness
into states that would otherwise take decades to attain.

God gave us the Great Work,
so we could carry out our spiritual transformation,
and He gave us intellect to develop technologies to
accelerate our efforts in the Great Work.

These technologies use sound and light
to help you successively unlock levels
of progress in the Great Work.

The technology is applied over two channels:
- audio  (Sound)
- visual (Light)

## Audio Channel
The audio channel is applied in successive layers,
each layer building upon the one before.
The true complexity of the implementation
has been watered down
to be presented here.

- base frequency
  + modern base frequency
  + solfeggio frequencies
    * modern      time keeping
    * traditional time keeping
  + resonant  frequencies
- pitch intervals
  + modern      temperament
  + traditional tuning
- scales, modes and chords
- tempo
- modulations and harmonic rhythm
- infrasound
  + binaural   beats
  + isochronic pulses
  + temporal   phasing
- textures
- melodic rhythm
- subliminal programming

### Base Frequency
There are three main schools of thought
for selecting the correct base frequency,
known as Tuning the Yellow Bell.
- modern base frequency
- solfeggio frequencies
- resonant  frequencies

More than trendy buzzwords,
this is the base frequency,
the pitch to which the pitch
ratios are relative.

#### Modern Base Frequency
A4 = 440 hz

#### Solfeggio Frequencies
These are commonly found in New Age traditions.
Within this category, there are two main schools
of thought for selecting the unit of measurement
for the solfeggio frequencies.
Both are measured in hertz,
or cycles per second.
- modern      time keeping
- traditional time keeping

For example,
A4 = 432 hz

##### Traditional Time Keeping
Most people know that traditionally,
sunset is considered to mark the beginning of the
day-night cycle.

But not as many know that the daytime proper was
considered to be the time between sunrise and sunset.
Dividing this period into twelve equal parts
marked the hours of the day.
The nighttime proper was likewise divided.

It follows from this that the specific
pitch represented by the solfeggio frequencies
would vary with the day-night cycle, the seasons
and even the progression of the equinox.

#### Resonant Frequencies
This method targets the resonant frequency
of an arbitrary substance under your environmental conditions,
such as temperature, pressure, gravity, etc.

The spectrum of pitches can be iterated
until the target resonates.

Usually, this technique is used to target
pure water or preferrably a saline solution.

### Pitch Intervals
These ratios are computed against the base frequency
and define the precise spacing between the notes
in the chromatic scale.

There are two main categories of techniques
for selecting the pitch intervals:
- modern      temperament
- traditional tuning

#### Modern Temperament
Simplifies handling of the various scales and modes,
eliminating traditionally unusable intervals.

#### Traditional Tuning
Uses relatively simple pitch ratios
to reduce acoustic beats
and to enhance the cymatic effects of
the base frequency.

### Scales, Modes and Chords
A scale is a subset of the notes in the chromatic scale,
and a layer of indirection.
Here, the chromatic scale is implied to have twelve notes.
Other chromatic scale lengths can be used,
but they each require significantly more
notes in order to get equal-enough spacing
between them within the octave.

Here, "scale" specifically refers to a septatonic scale.
The pentatonic scales can be treated as subsets
of the septatonic scales,
and are handled similarly to chords.

The mode or mood is a rotation of the scale.
The combination of scale and mode relates
to the Seven Seals.
Each of the Seven Seals colors the energy
with certain qualities.

Chords are subsets of the scale,
and perform different functions in each mode.
They comprise the vertical axis of harmony.

### Tempo
Entraining the heartbeat,
this musical feature combines with the mode,
which gives context to the induced
physiological state
to induce specific affects or emotions.

### Modulations and Harmonic Rhythm
The product of the axes of harmony,
these cause the movement of energy
through the Seven Seals.

A common misconception is that
collecting more energy into the Seals
will unlock them.
It instead causes stagnation of these energies.

Many traditions recommend releasing
the energy after the work.
This practice is successful,
because it does ultimately increase
the amount of energy which passes through the Seal.

In other words, the throughput of energy
unlocks the Seven Seals.
However, merely maximizing the throughput
can be inauspicious, as observed in Feng Shui.

The energy must be colored with certain qualities
and channeled at precise rates
to precise locations.
This is an arcane art, after all.

### Infrasound
This layer may be manifest
in either the pitch or the tempo,
depending the specific technology used.

This layer induces deeper states of consciousness,
which are necessary for advancement in the Great Work.
They furthermore increase the effectiveness
of prayers.

For maximum effectiveness,
the listener should audiate
the implied infrasonic pitch.
- Binaural   beats
- Isochronic pulses
- Temporal   phasing

### Textures
The pure tones are not heard in nature;
at this layer, they are imbued with elemental qualities,
by mapping the harmonic voices to instrument categories.

### Melodic Rhythm
This layer encodes the rhythmic cadence of the prayer,
and presents it to the conscious mind,
causing that rhythm to act as a sort of sigil
to activate the prayer.

### Subliminal Programming
The infrasound and melodic rhythm multiply
the effectiveness of this layer,
which embeds an arbitrary prayer
into the subconscious mind of the listener.

The prayer must be encoded in positive terms:
a positive affirmation.

Every thought creates an Angel,
so to speak, and this technology
increase the power of these thoughts
by several fold.

## Visual Channel
This channel is characterized by using
animations to enhance the viewer's mental retention
of sigils (yantras) for the purpose of visualization
and use as a focus during Dhyana Meditation.

Important graphics, including subliminal programming
are presented during syncopated beats.
For example, the animation might be paused at this point.

Aggregated data is accompanied with
music characterized by tritone intervals,
and anecdotal data is accompanied with
music characterized by perfect fifths.

Additionally, graphics can be used to
provide more context for interpreting
the tempo and mode.
