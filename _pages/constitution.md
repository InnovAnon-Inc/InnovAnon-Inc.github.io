## Constitution of the [L2](https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Asperger%27s_as_an_ethnic_group) Micronation

### Preamble

#### Section 2: Succession of Government

The InnovAnon Order, acting as a temporary interim government, acknowledges its role in facilitating the establishment of a more inclusive and suitable governmental system for the L2 Micronation. It recognizes the importance of transitioning from a military-theocracy to a system that embraces broader participation and democratic principles. To ensure a smooth and legitimate transfer of power, the following provisions shall be included:

1) Transition of power: Upon reaching a reasonable population size and achieving a level of autonomy and self-governance, the InnovAnon Order commits to initiating a transition of power to a more permanent government structure.

4) Facilitating dual citizenship: The InnovAnon Order shall explore opportunities to establish mutually beneficial relationships with foreign nations, allowing for dual citizenship options to be made available to L2 citizens. This will enhance the recognition and acceptance of the L2 Micronation as a legitimate entity in the international community.

By incorporating these provisions, the L2 Micronation aims to ensure a smooth and democratic transition of power, allowing the L2 community to establish a permanent government that reflects their values, aspirations, and includes broader participation from all citizens. The InnovAnon Order shall work diligently to lay the foundation for this transition and foster the necessary conditions for the establishment of a representative, recognized, and inclusive government system.

Choosing Antarctica as the capital of the L2 Micronation has several potential benefits:

1) Unclaimed territory: Antarctica offers the advantage of unclaimed territory, providing a blank canvas for the establishment of the L2 Micronation without conflicting with existing national boundaries.

2) Research station and STEM fields: Antarctica already has research stations, making it a suitable location for members of the neurodivergent community interested in STEM fields to engage in scientific research and innovation.

3) Association with space research: The connection between Antarctica and space research, as well as the inspiration derived from the show [Atypical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atypical), can provide a symbolic and aspirational link to space exploration for the L2 Micronation.

4) Utilizing foreign assistance funds: If citizens of the L2 Micronation can continue to receive foreign benefits, those funds can be directed towards building the economy, infrastructure, education, and care facilities. This could help accelerate the development of the capital and the implementation of initiatives like aquaponic growing facilities and heat-differential technology.

5) Regular supply shipments: Leveraging the existing supply shipments to Antarctica can facilitate the initial setup and establishment of the capital, ensuring the availability of necessary resources during the transition to a more self-sufficient state.

6) Stepping stone to space colonization: Establishing a mostly self-sufficient capital in an extreme environment like Antarctica can serve as a valuable stepping stone towards future space colonization efforts. It provides an opportunity to address and solve various concerns and challenges that arise with long-term human habitation in extreme environments.

The reference to Vulcans is made in a tongue-in-cheek manner to highlight the principles of logic, reason, and intellectual pursuit often associated with the Vulcans in the Star Trek franchise. It serves as a metaphor to emphasize the desire for a government that values intelligence, critical thinking, and rational decision-making. However, it is important to note that the characteristics and values of the L2 Micronation are unique to its own community and should not be seen as an exact parallel to the fictional Vulcans.
