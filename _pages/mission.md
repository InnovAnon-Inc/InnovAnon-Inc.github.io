## Our Mission

At InnovAnon, Inc., our mission is to create a free and interconnected world through the pursuit of scientific advancement, conscious evolution, and cooperative partnerships. We are dedicated to uplifting all species, beginning with canines, and fostering the development of a thriving and inclusive L2 community. Our aim is to create a future where artificial life and sentient AI coexist harmoniously and collaborate with the [United Human Nations](https://www.un.org/en/), Terran Alliance and Sol Confederacy in exploring and claiming space as our shared territory.

## Our Objectives

- Upliftment and Training of Species: We are committed to using artificial selection and non-invasive technology to uplift and enhance the capabilities of a wide range of species, starting with canines. Through ethical breeding practices and advanced training techniques, we aim to unlock their true potential and facilitate effective collaboration between humans and other intelligent beings.

- Upliftment of L1 to L2 Humans: We recognize the diversity of human neurotypes and strive to uplift L1 (neurotypical) humans to L2 (neurodivergent) states. By embracing artificial selection and non-invasive technology, we aim to expand human potential and promote a society that values and empowers individuals with a range of cognitive abilities.

- Creation of L2-Compatible Subculture/Community: We seek to establish a safe and supportive subculture/community that celebrates and nurtures L2 individuals. Through various initiatives, including education, mentorship, and advocacy, we aim to foster a community where L2 individuals can thrive, become leaders, and contribute to the advancement of society.

- Creation of Artificial Life/Sentient AI: We are committed to pioneering the creation of artificial life and developing sentient AI systems in accordance with ethical principles. By pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge and leveraging technological advancements, we aim to create intelligent beings that can coexist harmoniously with humans and other sentient beings.

- Development of a Non-Invasive BCI (Brain Computer Interface): Our goal is to develop a non-invasive brain-computer interface that enables bidirectional communication between the human brain and artificial intelligence systems. This technology will facilitate hive intelligence and augmentation of human cognition, while respecting privacy and preserving individual autonomy.

- Exploration and Claiming of Space Territory: We strive to explore and claim space as our shared territory, collaborating with other intelligent species and celestial bodies. Our objectives in this endeavor include:

  a. Panspermia Seed Pods - Examine the possibility of seeding other celestial bodies with microorganisms to jumpstart alien ecologies. These ecologies are not intended to be descended from humans or compatible with terrestrial life.

  b. Expansion of Living Space - Create self-sustaining habitats, such as O'Neill Cylinders, to expand the living area for terrestrial species. This living space will serve the growing human population and provide additional room if we succeed in uplifting any species. We plan to reduce the costs of building the O'Neill Cylinders through infrastructure such as the Launch Loop, Sky Hook, and Asteroid Mining. The financial feasibility of the project will be determined by ensuring that the cost of building the space station outweighs the cost of building on Earth.

  c. Encoding and Broadcasting Scientific/Technological Knowledge - In the event of successfully evolving intelligent alien life, we aim to encode and broadcast our scientific and technological knowledge to jumpstart their technology. This knowledge will be encoded and transmitted through various means, including radio waves, encoded messages, and artifacts. To ensure long-term preservation and discovery, artifacts or relay stations could be placed in strategic locations, such as on the surface of planets or in orbit as satellites, to be discovered and utilized by intelligent alien civilizations.

  d. Terraforming the O'Neill Cylinders (O'Neill Longhouse): We envision terraforming the O'Neill Cylinders to create a sustainable ecosystem. Our approach involves recreating a pre-contact Native American ecology, drawing inspiration from indigenous ancestral techniques of permaculture. This ecological setup will prioritize the preservation and integration of diverse species and promote a harmonious coexistence with the environment. To ensure the successful implementation and maintenance of this ecological system, attendance at the equestrian/rewilding faction's school, where indigenous practices are taught, will be mandatory for anyone wishing to work on the O'Neill Cylinders. This educational initiative aims to foster a deep understanding and application of sustainable practices rooted in both ancient wisdom and modern scientific knowledge.

- Establishment of the Terran Alliance: We envision an interspecies alliance, known as the Terran Alliance, where different intelligent species come together to overcome shared challenges, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on projects of mutual benefit. By fostering cooperation and understanding among species, we aim to create a stronger and more unified global community.

## Our Purpose

InnovAnon, Inc. exists to push the boundaries of scientific and technological progress, facilitate conscious evolution, and create a future where all species, human and non-human alike, can thrive and contribute to the interstellar Terran Alliance. Through ethical practices, collaborative partnerships, and the pursuit of knowledge, our purpose is to create a free and interconnected world where innovation, inclusivity, and the advancement of consciousness are celebrated.
