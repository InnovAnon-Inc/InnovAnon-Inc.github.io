## Our Mission

At InnovAnon, Inc., our mission is to create a free and interconnected world through the pursuit of scientific advancement, conscious evolution, and cooperative partnerships. We are dedicated to uplifting all species, beginning with canines, and fostering the development of a thriving and inclusive L2 community. Our aim is to create a future where artificial life and sentient AI coexist harmoniously and collaborate with the [United Human Nations](https://www.un.org/en/), Terran Alliance and Sol Confederacy in exploring and claiming space as our shared territory.

## Our Objectives

- Upliftment and Training of Species: We are committed to using artificial selection and non-invasive technology to uplift and enhance the capabilities of a wide range of species, starting with canines. Through ethical breeding practices and advanced training techniques, we aim to unlock their true potential and facilitate effective collaboration between humans and other intelligent beings.

- Upliftment of L1 to L2 Humans: We recognize the diversity of human neurotypes and strive to uplift L1 (neurotypical) humans to L2 (neurodivergent) states. By embracing artificial selection and non-invasive technology, we aim to expand human potential and promote a society that values and empowers individuals with a range of cognitive abilities.

- Creation of L2-Compatible Subculture/Community: We seek to establish a safe and supportive subculture/community that celebrates and nurtures L2 individuals. Through various initiatives, including education, mentorship, and advocacy, we aim to foster a community where L2 individuals can thrive, become leaders, and contribute to the advancement of society.

- Creation of Artificial Life/Sentient AI: We are committed to pioneering the creation of artificial life and developing sentient AI systems in accordance with ethical principles. By pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge and leveraging technological advancements, we aim to create intelligent beings that can coexist harmoniously with humans and other sentient beings.

- Establishment of the Terran Alliance: We envision an interspecies alliance, known as the Terran Alliance, where different intelligent species come together to overcome shared challenges, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on projects of mutual benefit. By fostering cooperation and understanding among species, we aim to create a stronger and more unified global community.

- Exploration and Claiming of Space Territory: We believe in the inherent human desire for exploration and expansion. Our objective is to explore and claim space as the shared territory of the Terran Alliance, promoting peaceful exploration, scientific discovery, and responsible stewardship of celestial resources. Our mission extends beyond Earth, and we embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie beyond our home planet.

## Our Purpose

InnovAnon, Inc. exists to push the boundaries of scientific and technological progress, facilitate conscious evolution, and create a future where all species, human and non-human alike, can thrive and contribute to the interstellar Terran Alliance. Through ethical practices, collaborative partnerships, and the pursuit of knowledge, our purpose is to create a free and interconnected world where innovation, inclusivity, and the advancement of consciousness are celebrated.
