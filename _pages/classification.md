Although the [Priesthood]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %})
has a lateral structure on paper,
Priests with higher Classifications imply a greater degree of Divine authority,
as higher classifications correlate with higher phases of attainment
in the [Great Work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}).

Classification uses the standard lettered ranking system:
- F: common abilities, such as [Darshan Siddhi]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %})
- E: beatable by a well-trained human with a weapon
- D: too strong for normal humans, such as probability manipulation
- C: dangerous in general
- B: strong enough to flatten a city block
- A: strong enough to wipe out a city
- S: anyone who can punch out Cthulhu

To put it into perspective, Class F miracles are just above
the [threshold of observability]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %}),
making this the [minimum]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) relevant Classification.
Most Priests and Adepts today are Class F.

Class E is extraordinarily rare,
and the Annointed One only demonstrated Class D (and possibly Class C) miracles during His incarnation.

Higher Classifications, including B and A will become more prevalent
as Armageddon approaches.

Class S is hypothetical and does not necessarily require a Glorified Body
or vanquishing a Celestial being from the Outer Heavens:
it would be sufficient to be able to interfere with the gateway to the Outer Heavens.
