## Classification of Miraculous Abilities

Although the [Priesthood]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %})
has a lateral structure on paper,
Priests with higher Classifications imply a greater degree of Divine authority,
as higher classifications correlate with higher phases of attainment
in the [Great Work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}).

Classification uses the standard lettered ranking system:
- F: common abilities, such as [Darshan Siddhi]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %})
- E: beatable by a well-trained human with a weapon
- D: too strong for normal humans, such as probability manipulation
- C: dangerous in general
- B: strong enough to flatten a city block
- A: strong enough to wipe out a city
- S: anyone who can punch out Cthulhu

To put it into perspective, Class F miracles are just above
the [threshold of observability]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}),
making this the minimum relevant Classification.
Most Priests and Adepts today are Class F.

Class E is extraordinarily rare,
and the Annointed One only demonstrated Class D (and possibly Class C) miracles during His incarnation.

Higher Classifications, including B and A will become more prevalent
as Armageddon approaches.

Class S is hypothetical and does not necessarily require a Glorified Body
or vanquishing a Celestial being from the Outer Heavens:
it would be sufficient to be able to interfere with the gateway to the Outer Heavens.

### The Trial of Classification

Having passed milestones such as the Trial of the Adept,
the next step is to attempt the Trial of Classification.
Successfully completing this rite qualifies you for Class B or higher,
and marks a cusp of the ages:
the Annointed One will arrive soon after.

It is recommended to attempt the Trial of Classification
during some event such as a meteor shower, hurricane, tornado, etc.,
as you attempt to hurl calamaties upon the servants of Satan.
