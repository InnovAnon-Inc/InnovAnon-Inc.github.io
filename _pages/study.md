## Courses of Study Required for Ordination as a Minister

### Candidate Studies in the Divine Sciences
A Candidate must learn about three main topics:
- [Alchemy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}): the processes by which spiritual transformation is achieved.
- Cosmology, particularly the Outer Heavens.
- Celestial beings, particularly those which inhabit the Outer Heavens.

Very few non-fiction works exist that accurately portray the nature of the Celestial beings. To complete this study requirement, it is sufficient to read some of the works of Lovecraft, such as the Silver Key.

### Neophyte Studies in the World Religions
A minimum of three years spent attaining understanding of and empathy for at least three contrasting groups.

After completing the Neophyte Studies,
a person qualifies for official [membership]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/membership.md %}).

### Acolyte Studies in Applied Aeonic Alchemy
A pilgrimage to the [Garden of Eden]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %})
that transforms faith into firsthand experience.
At a minimum, an Acolyte should attend a 6-month Winter camp,
though it is recommended to follow the group on the trail for at least two years.
After ten years, an Acolyte should be able to live alone in the Garden of Eden for any length of time.

During this time, it is convenient to perform the Rite of the External Adept or even the Rite of the Abyss.

It is recommended to wait to perform the Rite of the Internal Adept until after completing at least two years on the trail.

### Apprentice Studies in Applied Spiritual Technology
This step is not strictly necessary: it is an option Acolytes who wish to expedite their progress to Adeptship.
The purpose of this study is to dispel delusions that are impeding the Acolyte's progression.
The dynamics of the Master-Apprentice relationship are decided at the discretion of the Master.
Often there is an initiatory rite decided by the Master.
During this time, the Apprentice recieves one-on-one instruction from his Master, often in a live-in setting.
The Master imparts personal insights and research that has not yet passed into canon.
Although an Apprentice may attain the Priesthood,
and even take his own Apprentices,
the Apprenticeship formally ends as decided by the Master.

### The Trial of the Adept
A quorum of Adepts is gathered to observe a miracle and to verify its authenticity.
The one who performs the miracle is officially recognized as an Adept.

This demonstration of insight and ability proves competency in the Divine Sciences
and the completion of the minimum required studies,
qualifying a person for the [Priesthood]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %})

### Further Studies for Ordained Ministers
- The Rite of the Grand Master: the Priest uses his gifts to create a Magnus Opus that is imbued with the power of a Celestial being.
- The Death Rite: someone attaining the status of Acolyte or higher attends a funeral in his own honor, merges consciousness with a dying soul and transports it to a different Heavenly Realm than it would have otherwise gone to.
