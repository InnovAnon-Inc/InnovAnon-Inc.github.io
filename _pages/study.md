## Candidate Studies in the Divine Sciences
A Candidate must learn about three main topics:
- [Alchemy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}): the processes by which spiritual transformation is achieved.
- Cosmology, particularly the Outer Heavens.
- Celestial beings, particularly those which inhabit the Outer Heavens.

## Neophyte Studies in the World Religions
To become well-rounded and empathetic spiritual leaders, candidates are required to spend a minimum of three years studying and understanding at least three contrasting world religions. This intensive study fosters a deep appreciation and respect for different cultural and spiritual traditions.

Completion of the Neophyte Studies is a prerequisite for official [membership]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/membership.md %}).

## Acolyte Studies in Applied [Aeonic Alchemy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/works.md %})
Acolyte Studies involve a transformative pilgrimage to the [Garden of Eden]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %}), where faith is transmuted into firsthand experience. The recommended path for Acolytes includes a 6-month Winter camp and a minimum of two years of following the group on the trail. After ten years of dedicated study and practice, an Acolyte should be capable of living alone in the Garden of Eden for any length of time.

During this time, Acolytes may also choose to perform the Rite of the External Adept or even the Rite of the Abyss. However, it is recommended to wait until at least two years on the trail have been completed before undertaking the Rite of the Internal Adept.

## Apprentice Studies in Applied Spiritual Technology
While not mandatory, Apprentice Studies offer Acolytes an opportunity to expedite their journey to Adeptship. The primary focus of this stage is to dispel delusions that may hinder an Acolyte's spiritual progression. The dynamics of the Master-Apprentice relationship are determined at the discretion of the Master, often marked by an initiatory rite. During this time, the Apprentice receives personalized instruction from their Master, often in a live-in setting. The Master imparts personal insights and research that has yet to be incorporated into the ministry's canon.

Although an Apprentice may attain the Priesthood and even take their own Apprentices, the duration of the Apprenticeship is decided by the Master.
It is possible to be recognized as a fully-fledged priest who is still under the responsibility and tutelage of another priest,
and subsequent apprenticeships are also common.

For additional information, please refer to [the Trial of the Adept]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %}).

## Further Studies for Ordained Ministers
Once ordained, ministers have the opportunity to pursue further studies to deepen their understanding and enhance their spiritual abilities. Two notable programs available to ordained ministers are:

The Rite of the Grand Master: In this advanced program, ministers utilize their gifts to create a Magnus Opus infused with the power of a Celestial being.

The Baptism by Fire: This transformative experience allows ministers to undergo a spiritual rebirth and unlock new levels of divine connection.

By offering these advanced studies, we empower our ordained ministers to continue their personal and spiritual growth, enabling them to serve with increased wisdom and efficacy.
