How it might look through a lense of ignorance,
presented in six main categories:
- Philosophy
- Religion
- Politics
- Lifestyle
- Religious Practices
- Goal

## Philosophy
Advaita Vedanta Sanatan Dharma; some form of Shaivism.

The name, "The Way of the Creator" being a play on words
of the heretical concept, "The Cult of Brahma,"
paying homage to its Left-Hand origins.

## Religion
Apocalyptic with an alarming rate of [martyrdom]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/history.md %}),
integrating and emphasizing the Lovecraftian aspects
of the world religions,
and painted with a Christian veneer.

The Gospel is a mind-virus to which the masses need only be made privy.

[Creed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/creed.md %}) and [doctrine]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/doctrine.md %}).

## Politics
Post-civilized transhumanism.
Fairly egalitarian and even anarchistic,
given the [lateral]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}) nature
of the [ecclesiastical hierarchy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/government.md %}).

A literal religious zeal for free food and lodging
("Sacrament," "The Garden of Eden",
[meeting places]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/places.md %})).

## Lifestyle
Fanatical cultists "[doing God's work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}),"
their fervent actions tempered by a good night's sleep
and a number of physically intensive [initiatory rituals]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}),
fueled by free food,
eaten as ceremonial cannibalization of an Ascended Master.

## Religious Practices
Presented in two spheres:
- [Individual]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}) Worship
  + sleep
  + sleep-related activities
  + sitting and doing nothing
  + walking and doing nothing
  + looking at the sun
  + listening to repetive rhythms of certain frequencies
  + playing bizarre videogames
  + [camping trips]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %})
- [Group]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %}) [Worship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/services.md %})
  + blasphemous singing
  + subliminal messages embedded in the hymns
  + looting the donation bin
  + chanting, "[The Gate is Open]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %})"
  + more camping trips

## Goal
To open a gateway to some form of abyss,
allowing otherworldly entities to come into our world,
the sight of which will have catastrophic effects,
including the collapse of civilization
and the rebuilding of a dystopia
with a supreme dictator for life
with alleged [magic powers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/siddhi.md %}),
including some form of eternal life.

...and they're going to space.
