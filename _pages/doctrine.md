The Doctrine expounds upon the [Creed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/creed.md %}),
defining canonical dogmas.

The Code of Discipline expounds upon the Form of Worship,
listing a series of abstract directives,
by which the Divine Plan is carried out on an individual and Aeonic level.

## Doctrine
- The Nature of God:
  The Doctrine of the Nature of God is common among mystical traditions around the world.
- The Celestial Beings:
  The Doctrine of Celestial Beings avoids confusing Them for the One God.
- The Glorified Body:
  The Doctrine of the Glorified Body follows from the Doctrine of the Celestial Beings.
- Salvation:
  The Doctrine of Salvation involves the attainment of the Glorified Body.
- The Heavenly Realms:
  Dogmas involving the topology of the Heavenly Realms,
  however only the Outer Heavens are canonical.

  The process by which consciousnesses are sorted into the Heavenly Realms.

  The grand scheme of things on a personal and Aeonic level.

  A literal state of the Earth; the Holy Land.
  There are physical sites where you can experience the Garden of Eden firsthand.

  A phenomenon that will happen when the gateway to the Outer Heavens opens.
- The Kingdom of Christ:
  An age during which the Celestial Beings will again live among us,
  when we will be unified under the Annointed One.

### The Nature of God
God encompasses all that exists,
although He is beyond existence.
All conscious minds are like eyes on the face of God.
Being beyond existence,
we cannot fully grasp His nature,
but we can try to ascertain fragments by His titles:
- The One
  [![The One](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7CQmUMDxXjI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CQmUMDxXjI)
- The Godhead
- Truth
  [![Truth](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MohAKdL4ftE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MohAKdL4ftE)
- The All
- The Creator
  [![Creator](https://img.youtube.com/vi/a2LELlE430s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2LELlE430s)
- The Fearless One
- Without Adversary
- Timeless
- Undying
- Without Birth
- Self-Existent
- The Way
- The Light

### The Celestial Beings
Consciousness beings which inhabit the Heavenly Realms,
otherwise known as Angels.
They have different roles, including interacting with humans ordinary life, and carrying laws of nature.
We acknowledge the concept of angels both as anthropomorphic (to a degree) and abstract.

### The Glorified Body
A body that can exist in the Outer Heavens.

### Salvation by Faith and Works
Eternal Life, otherwise known as Salvation, is attained
by Faith and Works.

#### Faith
Faith in the Divine Plan, and the greatest expression of that Faith is action: carrying out the Works to bring that plan to fruition.

#### Works
The most important work is the [Great Work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}) in preparation for your Glorified Body.

### Heavenly Realms
Includes dimensions beyond the third.

After death:
- Weak consciousnesses dissolve and dissipate into the aether.
- Sufficiently developed consciousnesses maintain their existence.

[![Heavenly Realms](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Olo3Lc_jkZc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olo3Lc_jkZc)

#### Purgatory
Some consciousnesses are bound by attachments to the material plane.
A permanent existence here cannot be maintained and minds that exist here grow tormented from the nature of the plane.
Being purged of attachments, a mind proceeds to Judgment.
These minds must proceed to Judgment before they dissolve into the aether.

As a result of this doctrine, practices such as burial, embalming, mummification, etc.,
known as Soul Harvesting, are considered perversions of the Divine Plan,
as they prolong suffering unnecessarily and delay Judgment.
They are also believed to cause hungry ghosts and other disruptive phenomena.

Instead, it is encouraged that final procedings include an open-air cremation
along with the customary skull-bashing
that grants mercy to a soul, allowing it to proceed to a "better" heaven after Judgment.

#### Heavens and Hells
By a process known as judgment, minds synchronize with planes of existence corresponding to their nature.
There are Heavens and Hells for each chakra,
and myriads beyond that.
- Heavens: benevolent minds inhabit these planes of existence and perform penances for other souls for a while before reincarnating to continue the process of transformation.
- Hells: tormented minds are attracted to tormented places where they perform penances several times over for their sins before being allowed to reincarnate.

####  The Outer Heavens
Beyond existence and beyond the comprehension of causal entities.
It is known to be fatal for a causal entity to look upon the true form of beings of the Outer Heavens.

[![Celestial Beings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4r5OgLFuykM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r5OgLFuykM)

### Judgment
The automatic process by which minds are sorted into Heavens and Hells in the afterlife.

### Prophets
People throughout history who have interacted directly with the Angels of God.

[![Prophets](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ob7PfxvJCN0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob7PfxvJCN0)

### Divine Books
Books that record the words of the prophets.
Often they've altered for some purpose or another,
but they have still managed to carry down
a message to us through the ages,
however distorted.
They should be treated for what they are
and approached with a scientific mind.

### Miracles
The manifestation of certain gifts imbued by the Angels of God.

### The Divine Plan
The Divine Plan is spiritual transformation.

### The Garden of Eden
A literal garden, of which [few fragments remain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %}), that once encompassed the entire planet where people can live in the same state of freedom as Adam.

### Armageddon
Also known as the Final Judgment,
this is a necessary reset to restore the Garden of Eden and to establish the Kingdom of Christ.

[![Armageddon](https://img.youtube.com/vi/trArQ8JPEno/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trArQ8JPEno)

### The Kingdom of Christ
The Annointed One will establish a galactic kingdom.
The Garden of Eden will be restored on Earth and propagated throughout the galaxy.
Celestial beings will again live among us for a time.

## Code of Discipline
We have a specific [mission]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %})
with clearly defined steps to realize it
using spiritual technologies
that have been handed down from on high,
preserved through the ages,
expanded during millennia of research
in the [Divine Sciences]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}),
distilled and ultimately presented herein
for you to digest and internalize.

For the most part, "morality" is expressed in positive directives.
Despite the cliche, for every rule, there is a reason.

As they say, "There is no such thing as extra;"
such additional recommendations enhance the benefits you are already receiving,
in order to accelerate your progress.

Following the code of discipline will enhance your life and further your spirituality:
the Celestial beings will imbue you with gifts that will help you carry out God's plan,
and you will ultimately attain access to the Outer Heaven.

- Do your best to carry out what you can discern of God's Plan
  by developing a [personal relationship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}) with the Angels of God
  and Their [Priesthood]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}).
- [Transform]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
  your consciousness to inhabit your Glorified Body.
- Perform [prayer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %})
  and [contemplation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contemplation.md %}).
- Actively work to bring about the Kingdom of Christ
  by [spreading knowledge](http://www.losethegame.net/) of the Gospel's existence
  and by restoring the [Garden of Eden]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %}).
- Establish [congregations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %})
  and attend regular [services]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/services.md %}).
- Increase your [classification]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/classification.md %})
  and perform [penances]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/penance.md %}) in preparation for Armageddon.
