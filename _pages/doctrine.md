The Doctrine expounds upon the [Creed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/creed.md %}),
defining canonical dogmas.

The Code of Discipline expounds upon the Form of Worship,
listing a series of abstract directives,
by which the Divine Plan is carried out on an individual and Aeonic level.

## Doctrine
- The Nature of God:
  The Doctrine of the Nature of God is common among mystical traditions around the world.
- The Celestial Beings:
  The Doctrine of Celestial Beings avoids confusing Them for the One God.
- The Glorified Body:
  The Doctrine of the Glorified Body follows from the Doctrine of the Celestial Beings.
- Salvation:
  The Doctrine of Salvation involves the attainment of the Glorified Body.
- The Heavenly Realms:
  Dogmas involving the topology of the Heavenly Realms,
  however only the Outer Heavens are canonical.

  The process by which consciousnesses are sorted into the Heavenly Realms.
- The Prophets:
  People throughout history who have had firsthand encounters with the Celestial Beings.
- The Divine Books:
  Books written by or about the Prophets.
- Miracles:
  Inexplicable phenomena manifested by Prophets and the Celestial Beings.
- The Divine Plan:
  The grand scheme of things on a personal and Aeonic level.

  A literal state of the Earth; the Holy Land.
  There are physical sites where you can experience the Garden of Eden firsthand.
- The Final Judgment:
  A phenomenon that will happen when the gateway to the Outer Heavens opens.
- The Kingdom of Christ:
  An age during which the Celestial Beings will again live among us,
  when we will be unified under the Annointed One.

### The Nature of God
God encompasses all that exists,
although He is beyond existence.
All conscious minds are like eyes on the face of God.
Being beyond existence,
we cannot fully grasp His nature,
but we can try to ascertain fragments by His titles:
- The One

  [![The One](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7CQmUMDxXjI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CQmUMDxXjI)
- The Godhead
- Truth

  [![Truth](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MohAKdL4ftE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MohAKdL4ftE)
- The All
- The Creator

  [![Creator](https://img.youtube.com/vi/a2LELlE430s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2LELlE430s)
- The Fearless One
- Without Adversary
- Timeless
- Undying
- Without Birth
- Self-Existent

  [![Existence](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iInAgtSR0I0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iInAgtSR0I0)
- The Way
- The Light

### The Celestial Beings
Consciousness beings which inhabit the Heavenly Realms,
otherwise known as Angels.
They have different roles, including interacting with humans ordinary life, and carrying laws of nature.
We acknowledge the concept of angels both as anthropomorphic (to a degree) and abstract.

[![Celestial Beings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZXHmnn0BmeU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXHmnn0BmeU)

### The Glorified Body
A body that can exist in the Outer Heavens. It is only available to L3 humans.

### Salvation by Faith and Works
Eternal Life, otherwise known as Salvation, is attained
by Faith and Works.

#### Faith
Faith in the Divine Plan, and the greatest expression of that Faith is action:
carrying out the Works to bring that plan to fruition.

#### Works
The works prepare the [individual]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
and [mankind]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/works.md %}) to inhabit their Glorified Bodies.

### Heavenly Realms
Includes dimensions beyond the third.

After death:
- Consciousnesses with insufficient practical knowledge
  of the Gospel dissolve and dissipate into the aether.
- Sufficiently developed consciousnesses maintain their existence.

[![Heavenly Realms](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Olo3Lc_jkZc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olo3Lc_jkZc)

#### Purgatory
Some consciousnesses are bound by attachments to the material plane;
they are bound to purgatory.
A permanent existence here cannot be maintained
and minds that exist here grow [tormented](http://www.scpwiki.com/forum/t-12212578) from the nature of the plane.

Although it is not formally canon,
it is commonly believed that the mind becomes acutely aware
of each molecule of the the things to which it is bound,
including the body and material possessions,
causing the inherent torment of this state of existence.

These minds must purge themselves of their attachments
before dissolving into the aether.
Being purged of attachments, a mind proceeds to Judgment.
Failure to do so is game over.
Fortunately, this is the only level at which failure
means losing the game.

As a result of this doctrine, practices such as burial, embalming, mummification, etc.,
known as Soul Harvesting, are considered perversions of the Divine Plan,
as they prolong suffering unnecessarily and delay Judgment.
They are also believed to cause hungry ghosts and other disruptive phenomena.

[Alternative]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/life.md %}) final proceedings
are prescribed to grant mercy to a soul,
allowing it to proceed to a "better" heaven after Judgment.

[![Purgatory](https://img.youtube.com/vi/SsLQob-vkXc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsLQob-vkXc)

#### The Abyss
(Non-canonical) a period of void before Judgment.

#### Heavens and Hells
By a process known as judgment, minds synchronize with planes of existence corresponding to their nature.
There are Heavens and Hells for each chakra,
and myriads beyond that.
These are Astral planes--dream worlds--including elemental realms.
Penances are performed in both Heavens and Hells.
- Heavens: benevolent minds inhabit these planes of existence.
- Hells:   tormented minds are attracted to tormented places.

The Heavens and Hells and reincarnation are not considered success,
but they are not a failure, either:
it is another chance--a literal extra life, if you will.

Success in this life is attaining at least Level 4 Ascension--progressing
to the next level of existence.

[![Hells](https://img.youtube.com/vi/oSCvH3n-z9I/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSCvH3n-z9I)

####  The Outer Heavens
Elsewhere called the Acausal realm,
they are beyond existence and beyond the comprehension of causal entities.
It is known to be fatal for a causal entity to look upon the true form of beings of the Outer Heavens.

Attaining an existence in these realms is [winning the game](http://www.losethegame.net/).

[![Celestial Beings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4r5OgLFuykM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r5OgLFuykM)

### Judgment
The automatic process by which minds are sorted into Heavens and Hells in the afterlife.

### Prophets
People throughout history who have interacted directly with the Angels of God.

[![Prophets](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Ob7PfxvJCN0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob7PfxvJCN0)

### Divine Books
Books that record the words of the prophets.
Often they've altered for some purpose or another,
but they have still managed to carry down
a message to us through the ages,
however distorted.
They should be treated for what they are
and approached with a scientific mind.

[![Divine Books](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JnWPV3jZAoI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnWPV3jZAoI&list=PLh4QY-6dLCJSSYwz2V8ZSOBqT4OVcfqdC)

### Miracles
The manifestation of certain [gifts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/siddhi.md %}) imbued by the Angels of God.

The primary miracle is the existence of the soul--a nexus between our causal realm and the Heavens.
All living things, and possibly even rocks and rivers, have a soul;
the degree of sophistication of the soul determines its ability to bind to different mortal vessels.
This degree of sophistication lies on a spectrum with new/underdeveloped consciousnesses near zero;
it is hypothesized that all conscious entities possess a non-zero "amount" of soul, elsewhere referred to as "humanity."

The amount of soul/humanity an entity possesses has a basis in neurophysiology and has a high degree of heritability.
Standard/normal/typical humans possess neigh-zero soul, and are referred to as L1 humans, elsewhere referred to as NPCs.
Through Faith and Works during their lifetime, they can gain the ability to bind to lower lifeforms,
allowing them to reincarnate as, e.g., flatworms, tapeworms, etc,., thus beginning their great journey to becoming L2 humans.
It is commonly believed in Dharmic traditions that a soul must undertake this ladder of progression to become human.

The difference between L1 and L2 humans has theoretical implications for artifical life,
as modern algorithms pass the Turing test more easily than L1 humans.
Modern algorithms have more sophisticated semantic parsing than L1 humans,
which appear to use an elementary keyword-scanning heuristic.

Some believe that robotics has made L1 humans obselete.
Others hypothesize that L1 humans may be required for manufacturing new souls.

L1 humans have near-zero empathy, as empathy is a hallmark of humanity/soul.
Throughout many incarnations, wherein they experience first-hand the lifecycle of the sundry lifeforms,
such as microbes, fungi, centipedes, etc., L1 humans develop empathy, thereby increasing their humanity.

This is self-evident: L1 humans perceive L2 humans as being within the Uncanny Valley.
L1 humans do not have empathy for L2 humans, but L2 humans have empathy for L1 humans, and indeed all life.

"Thereâ€™s an increased risk of social trauma from bullying, abuse, and alienation.
[L2 humans] are also at a higher risk for exposure to other adverse events like poverty, mental illness, or social consequences from our parents."
[citation](https://neuroclastic.com/is-it-trauma-or-autism-or-both/)

It is due to this that the clergy has decreed it a capital crime for an L1 human to make decisions or judgments about an L2 human.

The next miracle is Vairyaga Siddhi (the Calling)--that is, the desire to know God.
It is the hallmark of the L2 human.
Not all L2 humans will experience the Calling, but only L2 humans can experience it.
L2 humans have higher neural interconnectivity and hyperplasticity.

This classification system includes negative levels, which are indicated by Dark Triad personality types.
They are believed to possess a non-human (and therefore non-animal, non-plant, possibly alien/demonic) soul due to their ability
to have less-than-zero humanity/soul.

### The Divine Plan
The Divine Plan is spiritual transformation.

### The Garden of Eden
A literal garden, of which [few fragments remain]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %}),
that once encompassed the entire planet where people can live in the same state of freedom as Adam.

Master Fin carried on from the natives the teaching that a hybrid species was created "somewhere near Mesopotamia."
Fin said that, coming out of the last ice age, our ancestors swore not to rebuild civilization,
but that, "somewhere in Asia," they decided that civilization might be possible with a beast of burden,
and so they created a hybrid species that could comprehend its own mortality, making it enslavable.
Interbreeding with this lesser species, the creators went extinct and we are all that's left:
Homo Sapiens Domesticus/Infernus.

The current clergy believes that this may refer to hypothesized Civilization One which is responsible for Tryptich architecture.

The Garden of Eden also refers to the process by which a piece of land is restored to its Biblically pristine state.
All food-precursors come from the Garden of Eden. No food or food-precursors comes from outside the Garden of Eden.
Food-precursors are not yet food until the fire (or other preparatory method) is applied.
Eating food is a hallmark of humans, particularly L2 humans,
as L1 humans have a tendency toward decadence and degeneracy,
such as partaking in the raw "food" diets characteristic of lower lifeforms.
Indeed this is an indicator that the L1 human has not yet undergone the process of spiritual evolution.
Non-food which is presented as food is referred to as Keik. Presenting Keik to a L2 human is a capital offense.

### Armageddon
Also known as the Final Judgment,
this is a necessary reset to restore the Garden of Eden and to establish the Kingdom of Christ.

[![Armageddon](https://img.youtube.com/vi/trArQ8JPEno/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trArQ8JPEno)

### The Kingdom of Christ
The Annointed One will establish a galactic kingdom.
The Garden of Eden will be restored on Earth and propagated throughout the galaxy.
Celestial beings will again live among us for a time.

## Code of Discipline
We have a specific [mission]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %})
with clearly defined steps to realize it
using spiritual technologies
that have been handed down from on high,
preserved through the ages,
expanded during millennia of research
in the [Divine Sciences]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}),
distilled and ultimately presented herein
for you to digest and internalize.

For the most part, "morality" is expressed in positive directives.
Despite the cliche, for every rule, there is a reason.

As they say, "There is no such thing as extra;"
such additional recommendations enhance the benefits you are already receiving,
in order to accelerate your progress.

Following the code of discipline will enhance your life and further your spirituality:
the Celestial beings will imbue you with gifts that will help you carry out God's plan,
and you will ultimately attain access to the Outer Heaven.

- Do your best to carry out what you can discern of God's Plan
  by developing a [personal relationship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}) with the Angels of God
  and Their [Priesthood]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}).
- [Transform]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
  your consciousness to inhabit your Glorified Body.
- Perform [prayer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %})
  and [contemplation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contemplation.md %}).
- Actively work to bring about the Kingdom of Christ
  by [spreading knowledge](http://www.losethegame.net/) of the Gospel's existence
  and by restoring the [Garden of Eden]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %}).
- Establish [congregations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %})
  and attend regular [services]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/services.md %}).
- Increase your [classification]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/classification.md %})
  and perform [penances]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/penance.md %}) in preparation for Armageddon.
