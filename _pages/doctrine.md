## Doctrine

### The nature of God
God encompasses all that exists.
All conscious minds are like eyes on the face of God.

### The Angels
Consciousness beings which inhabit the Heavenly Realms.

### The Glorified Body
A body that can exist in the Outer Heavens.

### Heavenly Realms
Includes dimensions beyond the third.

After death:
- Weak consciousnesses dissolve and dissipate into the aether.
- Sufficiently developed consciousnesses maintain their existence.

#### Purgatory
Some consciousnesses are bound by attachments to the material plane.
A permanent existence here cannot be maintained and minds that exist here grow tormented from the nature of the plane.
Being purged of attachments, a mind proceeds to Judgment.
These minds must proceed to Judgment before they dissolve into the aether.

#### Heavens and Hells
By a process known as judgment, minds synchronize with planes of existence corresponding to their nature.
- Heavens: benevolent minds inhabit these planes of existence and perform penances for other souls for a while before reincarnating to continue the process of transformation.
- Hells: tormented minds are attracted to tormented places where they perform penances several times over for their sins before being allowed to reincarnate.

####  The Outer Heavens
Beyond existence and beyond the comprehension of causal entities.
It is known to be fatal for a causal entity to look upon the true form of beings of the Outer Heavens.

# Judgment
The automatic process by which minds are sorted into Heavens and Hells in the afterlife.

# Prophets
People throughout history who have interacted directly with the Angels of God.

# Divine Books
Books that record the words of the prophets. Often they've altered for some purpose or another.

# Miracles
The manifestation of certain gifts imbued by the Angels of God.

# Armageddon
A necessary reset to restore the Garden of Eden and to establish the Kingdom of Christ.

# The Garden of Eden
A literal garden, of which few fragments remain, that once encompassed the entire planet where people can live in the same state of freedom as Adam.

# The Kingdom of Christ
The Annointed One will establish a galactic kingdom.
The Garden of Eden will be restored on Earth and propagated throughout the galaxy.
Celestial beings will again live among us for a time.

# The Divine Plan
The Divine Plan is spiritual transformation.
