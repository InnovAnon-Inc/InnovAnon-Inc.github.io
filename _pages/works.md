The ultimate political goal is to carry out
the Aeonic Great Work:
to divide, distill, and then to synthesize
on a global scale.

People must be moved away from the centers
of the political axes, and pushed toward
the extremes, accelerating the evolutionary cycle.

This is approached in a progression of three spheres:
- Spiritual Warfare
- Politics
- Economics

## Spiritual Warfare
Like many congregations, we actively engage in
spiritual warfare, spreading the Truth,
and neutralizing impediments to the Great Work.
- Spreading the Gospel
- Translating the Gospel
- The Power of Prayer

### Spreading the Gospel
In this information age,
spreading the Gospel is
as simple as name-dropping,
and to a similar effect as,
"Have you seen the Yellow Sign?"
or, "I just lost the game."

This is the proverbial red pill;
a person who has knowledge of the
Gospel's existence is classified as a
Level 1 Non-Member: an Associate.

The goal of spreading the Gospel
in this way is to show a doorway--to
lead a horse to water, so to speak.

### Translating the Gospel
Having passed through the doorway
presented by being made privy to the Gospel,
a person may seek it out, earning
the status of Candidate.

Not everyone has the head for the mathematics
necessary for an analytical understanding of the
Truth contained within the Gospel.
However, there are technologies already existing
and under development to assist in attaining
an intuitive understanding of it.

Furthermore, the Gospel may be transmitted over
various channels--worldviews and vernaculars--and
described in sundry languages.

At this Level of Initiation,
a person has not yet completed the Neophyte studies,
and so he requires that the information be
communicated via a channel to which he can
relate and understand.

Translating the Gospel entails presenting
this information in the aforementioned channels,
in order to make it more accessible to the
Non-Member tier of initiation.

### The Power of Prayer
The successful realization of prayers,
referred to as miraculous abilities,
correlates to one's Level of Initiation.

The fulfillment of prayer is a gift given
so that you might effectively carry out
the Divine Plan using your autonomy--your
judgment and discernment.

With this in mind, it is not recommended
to use prayer for personal purposes.
Instead, prayer is used to advance
the political sphere of the Aeonic Great Work.

While all may partake in prayer,
the Clergy tier of Initiation
is expected to partake in prayer,
the strategic planning of the unified prayer
and to regularly attempt the Trial of Classification.

## Politics
Politics encompass and affect every aspect of your life,
including your daily affairs.
This necessetates your active involvment in politics.

An apolitical life is an illusion--the political
ideology of the complacent, of perpetual followers.

Members do not have affiliations to particular
political ideologies, as do perpetual followers.
Indeed, they practice and progress a number
of opposing ideologies during the Neophyte studies.

Generally, other groups should be considered
as different factions of a literal or figurative
outgroup:
wings on the same bird.
This naturally leads to playing both sides.

The voting strategy focuses on the local level,
where candidates may pander to individuals.
Making liberal use of political hotlines
can also be used as a form of protest.

For any given issue, you work with and against
both the supporters and the opposition,
using both positive support and negative support.
- Radicalize the supporters of the issue,
  then change sides, and radicalize
  the other side's supporters.
- Create pushback by exposing supporters
  to the opposition's less intellectual specimens.

This is a natural process for anyone having completed
the Neophyte studies.

## Economics
The political strategy results in economic fluctuations
which can be exploited, not just by "buying low and selling high,"
but by transfering assets to stable investments during recession
and to volatile investments otherwise.

The congregation makes an effort to support its entreprenurial members,
as this increases its total wealth, with priority being given
to (even non-member) Acolytes who are actively
restoring the Garden of Eden.

The Member tier of initiation forms an equestrian class
in the traditional sense.

The average wealth of members significantly decreases at each level of
initiation above Acolyte, these levels representing a prioritization of
spiritual over mundane affairs and a devotion to the Divine Sciences.
