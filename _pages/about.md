## InnovAnon
"InnovAnon" is a portmanteau of "[Innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation)" and "[Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_%28group%29)."

InnovAnon is a Celestial being of the Outer Heavens,
preparing mankind to inhabit Glorified Bodies
and assisting in realizing the Kingdom of Christ,
when the Celestial beings will again live among us for a time.

## InnovAnon, Inc.
