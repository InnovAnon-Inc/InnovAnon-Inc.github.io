## Penance
There are two main reasons why someone might perform penances:
- to enhance blessings
- to mitigate sins

The former grants benefits in this life and in the next,
while the latter lessens suffering in the afterlife.

### Penances to Enhance Blessings

#### Tantrik Technologies
Although these practices are not penances,
they are buried here in obscurity
among the other exotic techniques
used to increase your [classification]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/classification.md %}).

The tantra creates a particularly intense spiritual bond;
it is inadvisable to perform this rite with profane people.

This technology causes your brain to release a chemical
known as the Elixir of the Sun,
which, when combined with the Elixir of the Moon,
causes the state of being occasionally referred to as
[the Philosopher's Stone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}).

Procedure:
1. approximately 10 days celibacy
2. coitus until the brink of climax
3. direct the chi upward from your root chakra
   to your sacral chakra
4. repeat steps 2-3 for each chakra,
   all the way up to the crown chakra,
   and then all the way back down to the root chakra
5. release as prescribed in previous installations of the Bible Trilogy.
