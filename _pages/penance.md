## Penance
There are two main reasons why someone might perform penances:
- to enhance blessings
- to mitigate sins

The former grants benefits in this life and in the next,
while the latter lessens suffering in the afterlife.

### Penance to Enhance Blessings

#### Tantrik Technologies
Although these practices are not penances,
they are buried here in obscurity
among the other exotic techniques
used to increase your [classification]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/classification.md %}).

The tantra creates a particularly intense spiritual bond;
it is inadvisable to perform this rite with profane people,
and especially not with several profane people,
except if your particular spiritual training has prepared you for it
(in which case, your specific tradition may require such things).
If the tradition in your spiritual lineage hasn't had you
celebrate a [different sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghori#Medicine)
of Sacrament, then this exception does not apply to you.

Along this vein, it is possible to perform this rite
with somone in a lower phase of attainment than you,
drastically accelerating that person's progress,
but it is not recommended to do this too many times in one lifetime.

Once the minimum required phase of the Great Work is attained,
there is obviously an imperative to proceed to this step,
known as the Great Rite,
but it should only be performed between a Priest and a Priestess.

In the absence of a suitable partner,
it is recommended to use your newly attained [Darshan Siddhi]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %})
to give another meaning to "personal relationship" and
"communion" with the Celestial beings.

This technology causes your brain to release a chemical
known as the Elixir of the Sun,
which, when combined with the Elixir of the Moon,
causes the state of being occasionally referred to as
[the Philosopher's Stone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}).

Procedure for the Great Rite:
1. approximately 10 days celibacy
2. coitus until the brink of climax
3. direct the chi upward from your root chakra
   to your sacral chakra
4. repeat steps 2-3 for each chakra,
   all the way up to the crown chakra,
   and then all the way back down to the root chakra
5. release as prescribed in previous installations of the Bible Trilogy.

Certain moralities have evolved as a result of this ancient technology.
- Rejection of the Covenant of Abraham as a symbol of death.
  The practice is known to interfere with tantrik technologies which grant life.
  Therefore, the practice is associated with death in the canon;
  indeed, it was common among soldiers who swore a contempt for life.
  Furthermore, the practice directly contradicts New Testament Law:
  for a Gentile to perform this so called covenant,
  it is a rejection of God and a sacrifice to Satan.
- Rejection of Sodomy as it perverts the proper flow of chi.
- Rejection of Homosexuality as the Great Rite is not feasible between
  two members of the same gender without some form of sodomy.
  The Priesthood has abstained from canonizing this dogma,
  but the logistical considerations are left as an exercise for the reader
  if that's you're perogative.

### Penance to Mitigate Sins
