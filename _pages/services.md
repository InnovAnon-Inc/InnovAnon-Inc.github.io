The procedure for regular [congregations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %}) is:
- Sermon
- Hymns
- Unified [Prayer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %})
- Preparing and partaking in Sacrament
- Prayers of Thanks and Hymns of [Gratitude]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contemplation.md %})
- Discussion of church business (if necessary)
- Donations

Ideally a congregation should make Sacrament available at any time on any day that it is requested.

The Priesthood should hear confession and suggest penances.
Confession offers up information to the Priesthood which can act on that information.
The effect of those actions can mitigate the weight of your sins.

Individual priests may offer to perform miracles according to their ability.
These miracles are allowed at the discretion of the Celestial beings.
Examples include gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.
