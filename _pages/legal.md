## Instructions for 508(c)(1)(a) "Free Church"
- Purpose and Structure: Define the purpose, mission, and structure of your organization. Ensure that it aligns with the requirements of a church or religious organization as defined by the IRS.

- Choose a Name: Select a unique and appropriate name for your organization. Check with the Texas Secretary of State or other relevant agency to ensure the name is available and meets any naming conventions or requirements.

- Governing Documents: Prepare and adopt the necessary governing documents, including articles of incorporation and bylaws. These documents should outline the purpose, structure, governance, and operational guidelines of your organization.

- Incorporation: File the articles of incorporation with the Texas Secretary of State. This process typically requires providing basic information about the organization and paying the necessary filing fees.

- Employer Identification Number (EIN): Obtain an EIN from the IRS. This identification number is used for tax purposes and may be required for opening bank accounts and conducting other financial transactions.

- Tax-Exempt Recognition: While a 508(c)(1)(a) organization is tax-exempt, obtaining an official recognition letter from the IRS is not necessary. However, it is a good practice to maintain proper records and documentation to demonstrate your organization's tax-exempt status.

- Registration and Compliance: Register with and comply with any necessary state and local agencies, such as the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts and Texas Attorney General's Office. This may involve filing periodic reports and fulfilling any other requirements specific to Texas.

- Financial Management: Establish a system for financial management, including maintaining accurate records and accounts, separating personal and organizational finances, and implementing appropriate financial controls.

- Obtain Necessary Licenses and Permits: Depending on your organization's activities, you may need to obtain specific licenses, permits, or certifications. Research and comply with any applicable requirements at the state and local levels.

- Ongoing Compliance: Maintain compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including any reporting and filing requirements. Stay informed about changes that may affect your organization's operations or tax-exempt status.
