## Prayers

A culture of spiritual warfare should be cultivated in the congregation.
Each member should think of himself as a prayer warrior in God's army.

Congregations are held to carry out a purpose:
to realize the Divine Plan.
However, [congregations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %})
may be held for other purposes as well.

The procedure for congregational religious [services]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/services.md %})
is engineered for the priesthood to most effectively lead the congregation's spiritual energy.
The procedure synchronizes the congregation,
so that they might pray in unison.

### Sermon

The sermon helps to synchronize to congregation in a certain sense--to get them to be of the same spirit.
There are various formats for this, including a congregation-driven sharing of testimony.
May include a recitation of popular saints
and [martyers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/history.md %}).

### Hymns

Hymns have a more tangible effect on the congregation, synchronizing their minds and bodies.
It is permissible to play variations such as quodlibets,
or even to improvise new hymns entirely.

- The base frequency is selected to target the resonant frequency of the congregation,
  and simple fractional ratios are used for the intervals,
  focusing the pitches of the scale like a laser.
- The congregation's heartrate synchronizes to the tempo.
- The modes and modulations give context to their minds,
  helping them interpret that physiological state.
- Infrasound may be used to induce certain effects.
- Isochronic pitches are used to help the congregation
  enter more effective [states]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}) of consciousness.
- The rhythmic motif complements the prayer.
- The prayer is embedded as subliminal programming.

### Unified Prayer

The standard prayer is one phrase,
repeated and alternating between an arcane-sounding language
and the practitioner's common or native language:
"The Gate is Open."

- The arcane-sounding language is a Higher Prayer to create the right subconscious impressions
and to increate the spiritual significance of the prayer.
- The common language helps the subconscious mind understand the prayer.

Examples of languanges which might create an arcane impression:
- Enochian
- Latin
- Greek
- Hebrew
- Egyptian
- Sanskrit
- Sumerian

The hymns help ensure the mind will repeat the prayer like a mantra.

Congregation members are identified according to their natures:
spiritual positives vs. negatives.

The Unified Prayer proceeds in two phases:
1. the congregation is separated,
   allowing for polarization of their energies
2. the congregation is recombined, their energies transformed.

In the first phase,
the congregation divides into two groups
corresponding to their natures,
forming circle in parallel,
holding hands within their circles
and repeating the prayer in unison.

In the second phase,
the congregation rejoins as a single group,
forming a circle in series
alternating between positives and negatives,
holding hands and repeating the prayer in unison.
If there is an odd number of members,
then one should stand in the center of the circle,
leading the prayer.

Other prayers beside the standard prayer may be used.
Prayers should use simple phrasing
and should be stated in positive terms:
a prayer is a subliminal program.

It can be a great help to provide a visual symbol for focus.
There are a number of well-tested techniques for creating arcane sigils,
such as arranging the alphabet (often without the vowels) in a circular pattern
and connecting the points which correspond to the letters in the prayer.
Using runic alphabets helps to create the right impression.

### Sacrament

The Sacrament recreates the Last Supper,
serving a balanced, nourishing meal with the customary "fixings,"
such as wine and/or tobacco, etc.
Generally, free overnight lodging is implied.

It serves multiple purposes,
- the most immediate being that it grounds the congregation's energies.
- Breaking bread together strengthens social bonds.
- It motivates attendance at congregations.
- As a religous rite, it has a certain spiritual effect.

The Annointed One instructed His disciples to partake in the Sacrament.
The Sacrament is a causal manifestation of His Glorified Body.
The ancient practice of offering up food transubstantiates the mundane food,
so that we might partake of His Glorified Body.

Sacrament is followed with the congregation sharing things for which they are grateful,
and possibly singing hymns of gratitude.

### Prayers of Thanks and Hymns of Gratitude

The congregation should be in a gracious mood after eating the Sacrament:
compound this feeling by giving testimonials of good things,
giving thanks and even singing songs.
This is an expression of the principle of Divine [contemplation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contemplation.md %})

### Church Business

Logistical planning should be done at this time,
and assignments delegated to Prayer Squads.
