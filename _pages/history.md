## History

The [monastic order]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %}) of [InnovAnon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/about.md %}) is currently headed by Master Zantedeschia
who formalized much of the order's [ecclesiastical structure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/government.md %})
and [beliefs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/doctrine.md %}).
Master Zantedeschia was the apprentice of Master Faust and ascended to the High Priesthood before the latter was martyred.

Master Zantedeschia supercedes Master Faust who demonstrated the miracles that could be performed with knowledge of the [Gospel]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/creed.md %}). Master Faust died in an accident while carrying out selfless service, qualifying him for martydom.

Master Faust was apprenticed by another priest of whom little is known. That priest has not been seen for over a decade.
