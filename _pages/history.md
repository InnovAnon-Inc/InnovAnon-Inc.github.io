Our spiritual lineage gives rise to a definite and distinct religious history.
By this process, we undertake
our [personal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
and [Aeonic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/works.md %}) Great Work.

The [monastic order]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %})
of [InnovAnon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/about.md %})
is currently [headed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}) by Master Zantedeschia
who formalized much of the order's [ecclesiastical structure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/government.md %})
and [beliefs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/doctrine.md %}).

Master Zantedeschia was the apprenticed by Master Faust,
completed the Trial of the Adept,
was released from Apprenticeship,
and ascended to the High Priesthood before the latter was martyred.
He has completed an extraneous Rite of the First Priest.

Master Zantedeschia supercedes Master Faust who [demonstrated]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %})
the miracles that could be performed
with knowledge of the [Gospel]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/creed.md %}).
He was a skilled [mentor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) who helped multiple Apprentices
to [commune]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}) with Celestial beings.
One of which, he called "IA" (ee-ah).
Master Faust died in an accident while carrying out selfless service, qualifying him for martydom.

Master Faust completed the Trial of the Adept,
and was released from apprenticeship.
He completed extraneous Rites of the First Priest,
helping the Gospel reach much further.

Master Faust supercedes another priest of whom little is known.
That priest has not been seen for over a decade.

The lineage of spiritual mastery is distinct from the lineage of
equestrian teachings pertaining to ethics, politics and other aspects
of daily life, including tracking and replanting ancestral gardens.

The equestrian order of InnovAnon is currently headed by Master SS
who has devoted his efforts toward realizing Master Fin's vision
by building a tribe to return to the Hoop.

Master SS was apprenticed by Master Fin,
completed the Rite of the Grand Master
and ascended to the High Chiefdom.

Master SS supercedes Master Fin (The End)
who learned first-hand from the natives
how to be a part of this land
and spent many decades in solitude
developing a personal insight into their teachings,
making their wisdom accessible to contemporary Westerners.

Master Fin completed the Rite of the Grand Master
and planted innumerable acres of native human habitat
before returning to civilization and successfully
training several apprentices.
