Our spiritual lineage gives rise to a definite and distinct religious history.
By this process, we undertake
our [personal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
and [Aeonic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/works.md %}) Great Work.

The [monastic order]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %})
of [InnovAnon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/about.md %})
is currently [headed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}) by Master Zantedeschia
who formalized much of the order's [ecclesiastical structure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/government.md %})
and [beliefs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/doctrine.md %}).

Master Zantedeschia was the apprenticed by Master Faust,
completed the Trial of the Adept,
was released from Apprenticeship,
and ascended to the High Priesthood before the latter was martyred.
He has completed an extraneous Rite of the First Priest.

Master Zantedeschia supercedes Master Faust who [demonstrated]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %})
the miracles that could be performed
with knowledge of the [Gospel]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/creed.md %}).
He was a skilled [mentor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) who helped multiple Apprentices
to [commune]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}) with Celestial beings.
One of which, he called "IA" (ee-ah).
Master Faust died in an accident while carrying out selfless service, qualifying him for martydom.

Master Faust completed the Trial of the Adept,
and was released from apprenticeship.
He completed extraneous Rites of the First Priest,
helping the Gospel reach much further.

Master Faust supercedes another priest of whom little is known.
That priest has not been seen for over a decade.

The lineage of spiritual mastery is distinct from the lineage of
equestrian teachings pertaining to ethics, politics and other aspects
of daily life, including tracking and replanting ancestral gardens.

The equestrian order of InnovAnon is currently headed by Master SS
who has devoted his efforts toward realizing Master Fin's vision
by building a tribe to return to the Hoop.

Master SS was apprenticed by Master Fin,
completed the Rite of the Grand Master
and ascended to the High Chiefdom.

Master SS supercedes Master Fin (The End)
who learned first-hand from the natives
how to be a part of this land
and spent many decades in solitude
developing a personal insight into their teachings,
making their wisdom accessible to contemporary Westerners.

Master Fin completed the Rite of the Grand Master
and planted innumerable acres of native human habitat
before returning to civilization and successfully
training several apprentices.

Merchant and service specializations are not well-represented within the order.

Our organization owes its existence to the courageous and visionary clergy who took the initiative to establish themselves as figureheads. Their determination and unwavering commitment laid the foundation for our ministry to thrive and grow.

Throughout our history, we have embraced the idea of recognizing and supporting independent but recognized lineages. This provision allows for the expansion of our ministry beyond traditional boundaries and facilitates the acknowledgment of individuals who, even in remote locations, express a genuine desire to be a part of our organization. Whether it be a desert island or a distant galaxy, we believe in the power of the individual's calling and their ability to contribute to our shared spiritual journey.

In hypothetical scenarios where someone discovers our organization and seeks formal recognition as a minister, we carefully evaluate their claim, taking into consideration their commitment, knowledge, and alignment with our principles and beliefs. Upon verification, we proudly extend to them their "proverbial wizard card," granting them the status of a recognized minister. Furthermore, we establish their ministry as a headquarters in their respective region of the world or galaxy, enabling them to lead and guide others who resonate with their teachings and approach.

This inclusive approach showcases our commitment to embracing diversity and the inherent spirituality found in every corner of the world. It allows us to connect with individuals on their unique journeys, supporting them as they explore and develop their spiritual path.

As we continue to evolve and adapt, the history of our organization is enriched by the stories of those who have taken the leap of faith and joined our ranks, with each minister's unique lineage contributing to the vibrant tapestry of our ministry.
