## History

The monastic order of InnovAnon is currently headed by Master Zantedeschia who formalized much of the order's ecclesiastical structure and beliefs. Master Zantedeschia was the apprentice of Master Faust and ascended to the High Priesthood before the latter was martyred.

Master Zantedeschia supercedes Master Faust who demonstrated the miracles that could be performed with knowledge of the Gospel. Master Faust died in an accident while carrying out selfless service, qualifying him for martydom.

Master Faust was apprenticed by another priest of whom little is known. That priest has not been seen for over a decade.
