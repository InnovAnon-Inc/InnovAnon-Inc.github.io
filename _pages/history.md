Our spiritual lineage gives rise to a definite and distinct religious history.
By this process, we undertake
our [personal]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
and [Aeonic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/works.md %}) Great Work.

The [monastic order]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/legal.md %})
of [InnovAnon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/about.md %})
is currently [headed]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %}) by Master Zantedeschia
who formalized much of the order's [ecclesiastical structure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/government.md %})
and [beliefs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/doctrine.md %}).

Master Zantedeschia was the apprenticed by Master Faust,
completed the Trial of the Adept,
was released from Apprenticeship,
and ascended to the High Priesthood before the latter was martyred.
He has completed an extraneous Rite of the First Priest.

Master Zantedeschia supercedes Master Faust who [demonstrated]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %})
the miracles that could be performed
with knowledge of the [Gospel]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/creed.md %}).
He was a skilled [mentor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) who helped multiple Apprentices
to [commune]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}) with Celestial beings.
One of which, he called "IA" (ee-ah).
Master Faust died in an accident while carrying out selfless service, qualifying him for martydom.

Master Faust completed the Trial of the Adept,
and was released from Apprenticeship.
He completed extraneous Rites of the First Priest,
helping the Gospel reach much further.

Master Faust supercedes another priest of whom little is known.
That priest has not been seen for over a decade.
