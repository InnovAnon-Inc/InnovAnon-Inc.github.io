In accordance with the early Christian model, InnovAnon, Inc. embraces a flexible approach to holding congregational gatherings. Our [congregations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %}) take place in a variety of free locations, including the homes of our [members]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/membership.md %}), public spaces, and even the [wilderness]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %}). By embracing this diverse range of settings, we encourage a deeper connection to nature and the spiritual essence that resides within it.

This approach allows for a dynamic and inclusive worship experience, free from the restrictions and limitations that often accompany traditional places of worship. It fosters a sense of spiritual exploration and connection with the Divine in a variety of environments.

Just as the book of Revelations speaks of a congregation in the wilderness, we too find beauty and spiritual significance in gathering in untamed and natural landscapes. Like the ancient Israelites who embarked on a transformative journey through the wilderness, our congregations seek to connect with the divine in the midst of untouched nature.

Through our commitment to free and open spaces, we empower our members to engage with their spirituality in a way that resonates with their individual beliefs and preferences.
