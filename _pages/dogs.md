Training Program for Canine Intelligence Enhancement

- Selecting the Breeds:

  * Choose breeds known for their trainability, cognitive abilities, and compatibility with the goals of your breeding program.
  * Consider breeds such as Border Collies, German Shepherds, Poodles, Golden Retrievers, or Belgian Malinois.
  * Consider a popular hybrid breed such as labradoodles to increase interest and funding.

- Breeding Program:

  * Establish a breeding program with a focus on selecting individuals that exhibit high trainability and cognitive abilities.
  * Implement responsible breeding practices, considering genetic diversity and health.
  * Start with a population of approximately 50 dogs to maintain genetic diversity.

- Feeding Program:

  * Feed dogs cooked food from weaning/adoption, utilizing various cooking techniques for different parts of the animal.
  * Use bones to create broth, reduce broth for demi-glace, grind softened bones for kibbles, bake skins to render animal fat for chips, and sear organs and muscles for pan sauces or gravies.
  * Include specific herbs with the consent of the canine, engaging their preferences and sense of smell.
  * Evaluate whether this feeding program increases delayed gratification and planning skills and enables an increase in cranial capacity.

- Language Program:

  * Teach dogs a wide range of nouns, including names of plants, animals, and household items.
  * Interact with dogs using complete, grammatical, or idiomatic sentences.
  * Teach non-verbal or sign language cues along with spoken language.
  * Use simplified language similar to communicating with a very young child.
  * Explain actions and plans to develop a deep understanding of their environment and tasks.
  * Integrate communication devices and numerical training.

- Contextual Awareness:

  * Train dogs to adapt their behavior in different settings:
  * Wilderness Camp: Teach boundaries and behavior around horses and wildlife.
  * Home: Train dogs to operate the backdoor, roam freely in the backyard, and respect boundaries.
  * Other People's Homes: Teach dogs to request to go out and promptly return indoors, adapting to different rules.
  * Public Places: Train dogs to stay within leash-distance and exhibit good behavior around people and dogs.
  * Cultural Events: Expose dogs to various events to learn proper behavior and interaction.
  * Mealtimes: Train dogs to behave during mealtimes, respecting food boundaries.

- Training Program:

  * Develop a training program incorporating puzzle toys, scent detection tools, and farming/hunting training:
  * Puzzle Toy Training: Introduce dogs to problem-solving puzzles, gradually increasing difficulty.
  * Scent Detection Training: Train dogs to identify and locate specific scents using their olfactory abilities.
  * Tool Training: Associate actions with tools like button panels, lever-action door handles, and refrigerator ropes.
  * Farming and Hunting Training: Teach dogs to farm, hunt, and check gardens for varmints, rewarding proper behavior.
  * Fetch and Retrieval Games, including fetching something by name, even if it wasn't thrown (e.g., go get the mail)
  * Search and Find Games, including finding something by name
  * Search Patterns
    1. Area Search Pattern
    2. Grid Search Pattern
    3. Tracking/Trailing Search Pattern
    4. Air Scenting Search Pattern
    5. Building Search Pattern
    6. Vehicle Search Pattern
    7. Static Line Search Pattern
    8. Article/Evidence Search Pattern
  * Flanking, etc. - TODO how ?
  * Short-Leash Training - for following
  * Long-Leash Training - for leading

- Writing System:

  * Develop a writing system based on symbols/hieroglyphs and the approximate number system for labeling signs and buttons.

Regular practice, consistent reinforcement, and ongoing evaluation are crucial for successful implementation. Collaborate with experts and trainers throughout the process to optimize outcomes. Adapt and refine the program based on individual needs, continually seeking opportunities for improvement.

Hypotheses to be tested:

- The feeding program, which incorporates cooked foods and engages the dog's preferences and sense of smell, will increase the canine's capacity for delayed gratification and planning and potentially enable an increase in cranial capacity.
- The language program, which includes teaching nouns, using complete grammatical sentences, teaching non-verbal or sign language, using simplified language, explaining actions and plans, and incorporating communication device training, will enhance the dogs' language development and comprehension skills.
- The contextual awareness training, which includes specific behaviors in different environments such as wilderness camps, home settings, other people's homes, public places, cultural events, and mealtimes, will make the dogs adapt better to various contexts and situations.
- The training program incorporating puzzle toys, scent detection tools, and tool training will enhance problem-solving skills, scent detection abilities, and the dogs' versatility in using different tools.
- The training program's emphasis on farming and hunting skills, including digging trenches, checking the garden for varmints, clean killing techniques, and teaching anatomy, will reinforce hunting and farming behaviors.
- The exposure to cultural events and communication with humans using a range of language skills will improve the dogs' social behavior and their ability to interact with humans in different settings.
- The hypothesis that the training program may have epigenetic influences on the in-born intelligence of the dog population, potentially leading to increased cognitive abilities.

Lifecycle of Specimens:

- Using a popular cross-breed to fund the operation and increase the genetic variety of the starting population is a feasible strategy. Cross-breeding can indeed create unique and distinctive characteristics that may be valued by potential buyers or adopters. Additionally, an increased genetic variety can be beneficial for the overall health and genetic diversity of the population.

- By providing "primary education" to the dogs and then advancing them to "secondary education" for their service roles, you are ensuring that the dogs receive specific training and skills necessary for their future roles. This structured approach can increase the dogs' value and prepare them for working with government agencies or other organizations.

- Breeding program: Once the dogs have completed their secondary education and any epigenetic switches have been activated, initiate the breeding program. Select individuals with high trainability, cognitive abilities, and desired traits to propagate their genetics and contribute to the future generations.

- Service Role

- Once the dogs have completed their service roles, retiring them to domestic service roles, companion roles, or emotional support animal (ESA) roles is a thoughtful and responsible plan. The dogs can continue to provide companionship and support to individuals in different capacities, utilizing their training and skills acquired during their service years.

Overall, this approach combines various aspects such as training, breeding, and retirement planning to create a comprehensive program for the dogs' development and future roles.

Implementing a funding model for the program would be a practical approach. Giving priority to reuniting retired service animals with their former handlers whenever possible is a wonderful initiative, as it helps maintain the bond and connection between the animals and their handlers, which is beneficial for both parties.

However, it's important to have a sustainable funding model in place to support the overall operation of the program, including the ongoing training, care, and support of the dogs. This could involve a combination of approaches such as seeking sponsorships, grants, donations, partnerships with organizations, and possibly limited adoption or sale of retired service animals to suitable individuals or families.

Creating a comprehensive funding plan that aligns with the goals and values of the program will help ensure its long-term success and the ongoing support of all the dogs involved, including both active and retired service animals.

Structure

In addition to the tax structures listed elsewhere, look into

- Fiscal Sponsorship: If your space-wizards organization is just starting out and does not yet have tax-exempt status, you may consider partnering with an existing nonprofit organization that is willing to act as a fiscal sponsor. This arrangement allows you to carry out your activities under the sponsor's tax-exempt status while you work towards obtaining your own nonprofit status.

- Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credits: If your organization is involved in scientific research or innovation related to canine intelligence or other areas, you may be eligible for R&D tax credits or incentives. These credits can help offset the costs associated with research and development activities.
