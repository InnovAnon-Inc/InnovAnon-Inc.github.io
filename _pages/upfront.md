At InnovAnon, Inc. Ministries, we believe in embracing diverse spiritual traditions and exploring the boundaries of human potential. As we delve into the realms of spirituality and supernatural phenomena, we recognize that some aspects of our doctrine may seem unusual or unconventional. In the spirit of transparency and openness, we want to present these aspects right upfront, ensuring that concerned parties can easily find them.

## Genetic and Neurodivergent Correlations
Many traditions suggest that supernatural abilities and neurodivergence may have a genetic component. We hypothesize a correlation between these two factors and use the occurrence of one as an indicator to test for the other, as well as an indicator to test one's lineage. While we are interested in family history and genetic traits, this does not negate the value and worth of individuals who do not exhibit these correlations.

## Testing Supernatural Abilities
Collaborating together, our Masters have established protocols to test for the occurrence of supernatural phenomena, particularly those that affect the physical world in obvious ways. Through controlled experiments and rigorous testing, we aim to assess the accuracy and extent of these abilities. We acknowledge that not all types of supernatural abilities can be objectively measured or demonstrated, and we continue to explore ways to understand and validate these experiences.

## Interest in Family History
Similar to certain religious traditions, such as the Mormons, we acknowledge the interest in family history and lineage. We recognize that family connections and genetic traits can play a role in the exploration of supernatural abilities. However, we also emphasize that spiritual growth and connection are not dependent solely on lineage but can be pursued by individuals from various backgrounds and experiences.

## Inspiration from Traditions
We draw inspiration from various spiritual traditions, including the Catholics and Mormons. While we admire certain aspects of these traditions, it is important to note that our path is unique and may diverge from some of their beliefs and practices. We strive to create a revival of the old ways while incorporating our own insights and understanding.

## Galactic Themes
We acknowledge that some aspects of our doctrine may touch upon galactic and celestial themes. However, we do not actively promote a belief in an intergalactic military dictatorship. We are committed to fostering inclusivity, personal growth, and spiritual exploration within the realms of human experience.

By presenting these aspects right upfront, we invite open dialogue, understanding, and constructive engagement. We aim to create an environment where individuals can explore their spirituality, develop their innate potential, and embrace their unique path, while acknowledging that interpretations and experiences may vary.
