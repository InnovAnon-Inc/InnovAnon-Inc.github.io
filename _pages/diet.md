The Elixir of the Black Sun:
how we refer to our dietary guidelines.

In this perspective, your body is a machine;
older perspectives see the body as a laboratory or a temple.
Foods are medicines; medicines are foods.
These substances are being mixed in the machine over a period of decades,
along with various exercises and other practices, such as meditation,
so that the machine can synthesize the philosopher's stone,
also known as ambrosia or the divine nectar.

This system will help get the most out of the food you eat,
and create the correct feeling for meditation and alchemical works,
while still allowing for some amount of enjoyment of worldly foods.

Before attempting anything contained herein,
it will benefit your health to learn about breatharianism,
research esoteric diets which have been used historically
(i.e., the participants lived long and healthy lives),
particularly yogic disciplines.

Owner and management NOT responsible for
injury or death resulting from the use
of these technologies.

One focus is sustainability and
giving life to what gives you life--the circle of life, if you will.
These are the basic principles of an alchemical diet:
- plant back 10% sprouts, as a sort of tithe
- vegetables should be harvested without killing, if possible, as seen with the Jains.
- minimal kitchen waste (you can get a lot of mileage out of fruit and veggie peels)

Meals are eaten slowly, and in silence;
each bite is chewed excessively.
The meals are rich and necessarily have some
number of herbs and/or spices.





NOTE the dietary guidelines are a work in progress,
requiring many hours of research from our clergy,
as well as many years of testing on human subjects.

The dietary guidelines are a complex issue and there is no formal, universal canon.
Different guidelines are decreed by various clergy.
Apprentices and laymen should refer to their local clergy for clarification.

The dietary restrictions began to be formalized only about 1-2 decades ago,
when Master Faust and his apprentice discovered a correlation between
diet and student progress in occult studies.

Since that time, the guidelines have undergone several revisions,
from banning processed foods, banning grains and beans,
preferring raw foods, allowing grains and beans under certain conditions, etc.

This is a regressive Western Neo-Pagan tradition.
Although our spiritual lineage is poorly-tracked, it was probably made up by some edgy goth in the 80s or 90s.
The tradition has always been focused on practice, and had little in the way of formal theory or rules.
As it has matured and the clergy has gained deeper familiarity with world traditions,
commonalities have been identified, some terminology has been borrowed and some practices have been emulated.
On one hand, the metaphysical aspects have reached deeper into the past, striving to discover some original occult truth,
and on the other hand, the pragmatic aspects have continued to adapt to the contemporary era.

There was a period when the dietary guidelines mostly borrowed from yogic traditions,
and so meats, dairy and eggs were banned. Indeed, eating anything dead was forbidden.

After integrating some native american influences, veganism was no longer required.
A purely carniverous variant of the dietary guidelines was introduced.

In the current version, we use traditional foods and preparation techniques as a baseline,
and merely attempt to elaborate on and explain these principles.

First we will clarify some definitions.
"Traditional foods," certainly means pre-industrialized,
but is often assumed to mean pre-civilized.

"Food," otherwise referred to as "The Elixir of the Black Sun,"
in religious contexts is only "food" if it is harvested and prepared
according to these guidelines. Otherwise, it is referred to as "keik"
(commonly pronounced "keek," latinized pronunciation "cake," germanicized pronunciation ellided, etc.),
and it is not considered "food."

Other traditions refer to "food," as "kosher," "halaal," or "jhatka,"
and refer to "keik," as "treif," "herem," or "haraam."

Since the baseline is precivilization, wild or otherwise freerange foods,
including vegetables and animals, are "food," or have the potential to be
processed into "food." Many wild varieties must be harvested at the right time (and possibly
after the right Winter conditions), and often have involved processes to remove toxins.
Acorns, for example, become "food" after the tanins are leeched out.

Some wild or freerange foods should be captured and kept in a controlled environment
for a short time before harvesting. Specifically, bugs, shellfish and other bottom feeders,
should be gut loaded.

Some foods may be captured and kept in a controlled environment for extended periods.
Microgreens are specifically allowed for, but they should be heirloom strains.
This can help prevent overgrazing in civilized settings.
The process for microgreens is not to be applied to animals; it is keik to harvest flesh without slaughtering.

Grains, beans, nuts, seeds, etc., should use some combination of sprouting, nixtamalization, cooking, fermenting, etc.

Tithing is necessary for the conversion to "food." Without proper tithing, there is no food.
Tithing cannot be done by proxy, except in extreme scenarios.
Stephen Hawking, for example, would be allowed to tithe by proxy if his chair could not be fitted with a jetpack.
Master Fin decreed that tithes must be paid to the wilderness.
Less fundamentalist clerics assert that tithes can be paid to any publicly accessible land,
allowing, for example, planting a fruit tree on your front lawn.

10% of all sprouts must be replanted.
Grains, beans, nuts, seeds, etc., are generally sprouted, then tithed.
Foods, such as potatoes, which should not be eaten sprouted, should be tithed, then sprouted.
Foods such as onions can be regrown from the root.
Rather than offering one out of every ten onions, it is acceptable to offer to roots of each onion.
Foods such as tomatoes are regrown from the seed.
Rather than offering one out of every ten tomatoes, it is acceptable to offer the seeds from each tomato.
Apple seeds have medicinal uses. In their case, one out of every ten apple seeds should be offered.

It important to verify at a later date whether your tithe was accepted.
If the plant does not grow, then the tithe was not accepted and you must adjust your tithing strategy in the future.
For example, we had a period of several years during which potatoes were not able to be tithed properly, and so all potato dishes were keik.
The potatoes were being improperly stored in too cold of conditions prior to offering.
Now that the problem has been identified, we are again able to make potato-based food.
However, varmints were digging out the sprouted potatoes, invalidating the tithes.
And so we began to dig up the rock-mosaic from beneath the soil, and put it back into its proper place, making the potatoes inaccessible to the varmints.

Not all tithes are created equal.
Your net native human habitat production should be greater than your net consumption.
If you are inept at tithing, then you will have to tithe more than 10%.
If you are skilled at tithing, then one shit is worth a mountain of berries, and you need not concern yourself with the 10% rule.

Tithing meat is more involved. It is the highest form of tithing, and requires a wholistic knowledge of the ecosystem.
Ultimately, as apex predators, we eat the same vegan diet as the rabbits or the hippies, albeit by proxy.
In order to tithe meat, you must plant the same gardens as the vegans do when they tithe.
You give life to the plants, which give life to the animals, which, in turn give life to you.
It is necessary to plan where the gardens are, where the grazing fields are, and where the forest buffers are.

There should not be a lot of kitchen waste.
Onion skins are useful for infusions.
For citrus, the pulp, zest and rind can all be used.
Even mango peels can be pickled and eaten.
Bones, once the gelatin is extracted, are crushable by hand
and can be consumed by humans and animals.

Traditionally, this kitchen waste is mixed with wood ash and allowed to compost.
Caution should be taken in the case of fire pits and bare spots left by tents, teepees, etc.
Anything can grow in these bare spots, and so it is our imperative as a keystone species to select
what will grow in these places.
You must plant native human habitat.

Master Fin advised that you will know whether you have been eating proper "food," by inspecting your stool.
It should be firm, clean pellets like a rabbit or a deer.

"Food" must be free. Freedom is life. Captivity is spiritual death.
"Food" must be offered up to be imbued with life essence.
Otherwise, it is "keik," and imbued with death essence.

Survival scenarios are accounted for.
In the case that there is no "food," or only "keik" is available,
causing reasonable likelihood of one's imminent demise or irreversible harm,
socially taboo forms of flesh may be consumed with the caveat
that this will be fatal in the long term.

Oral traditions allude to more extreme clergy liberally interpreting "survival scenarios,"
particularly within the Guardian tradition.
It should be noted that Guardians, although living martyrs,
were regarded as contagiously unclean, untouchable conduits of death essence.

Plain water is not considered "food."
Fire or sunlight generally should be applied to it,
to create some form of infusion or extraction.
Instead of water, herbal infusions are quaffed.
In cooking, water is often substituted with, e.g., onion-skin tea.

Ideally, meals should be eaten no more than once per day.

Another focus is to eat a diet that is conducive to alchemical works.
Aside from specific diets prescribed by various Sadhanas,
these general guidelines should suffice:
- regular fasting
- no water, use herbal tea instead (also applies when cooking)
- all foods/drinks must use some combination of herbs, spices and flowers
- staples are vegetables, fruit, seeds and nuts
- fruit is often fermented and soured to reduce sugar
- traditional staples, such as grains, beans, meats and dairy are limited to use as condiments
- max 1.5 cup grains daily, sprouted, preferrably fermented
- max 1   cup beans  daily, sprouted, preferrably fermented
- max ?   cup dairy  daily, preferrably fermented
- max ?   oz  meat   daily, optionally fermented

General fasting has three primary types:
- 1 day only herbal tea
- 1 day no food, no water
- 1 day smoothies and shakes

Specific fasting is used to resensitize receptors and lower tolerances.

Fasting discipline is divided into levels:
1. eat at most once per day
2. monthly cycle: any  type of fast is completed
3. monthly cycle: each type of fast is completed
4. weekly  cycle: any  type of fast is completed
5. weekly  cycle: each type of fast is completed
6. some form of fast more than half the days
7. perpetual fasting, broken only to partake in sacraments

The No-Water Rule:
~8 glasses of herbal tea, usually unsweetened,
but optionally sweetened with fruit juice or milk.
- after waking
- before bathing
- 30 min before meal(s)
- before sleeping

After waking, the drink is usually soaked chia seeds,
lemon juice or vinegar, and some combination of cucumber, mint, jalapeno, etc.

Before sleeping, the drink usually contains ascorbic acid or citric acid,
and possible cherries.

Limit the use of the normal staples.
They are spiritually empty and clog the system.
Instead they are used sparingly:
- meat used as a seasoning or condiment, usually in the form of broth and bacon bits
- grains and beans used as a seasoning, such as breading or other filler

Rather than the normal staples,
the alchemical staples are:
- the eternal stock
- spices such as: nutmeg
- flowers such as: passion flower, dandelion
- acids from citrus and fermented foods
- vegetables, predominantly cooked such as: ginger, tumeric
- fruits such as: lemons and cherries
- mushrooms
- seeds such as: flaxseeds, hempseeds, chia seeds, morning glory seeds
- nuts such as: peanuts, pistacchios, cashews

Timing:
- Caffeine, such as coffee, tea and chocolate should be taken early in the day.
- Cherry tea, cherry juice, poppy seeds should be taken late in the day.
