This system will help get the most out of the food you eat,
and create the correct feeling for meditation and alchemical works,
while still allowing for some amount of enjoyment of worldly foods.

The primary focus is on sustainability and
giving life to what gives you life--the circle of life, if you will.
These are the basic principles of an alchemical diet:
- plant back 10% sprouts, as a sort of tithe
- vegetables should be harvested without killing, if possible, as seen with the Jains.
- minimal kitchen waste (you can get a lot of mileage out of fruit and veggie peels)

Next is to eat a diet that is conducive to alchemical works.
Aside from specific diets prescribed by various Sadhanas,
these general guidelines should suffice:
- regular fasting
- no water, use herbal tea instead
- must use herbs/spices (medicinal/magickal properties)
- grains, beans, meats and dairy are essentially limited to use as condiments.
- max 1.5 cup grains daily, sprouted
- max 1   cup beans  daily, sprouted
- max ?   cup dairy  daily
- max ?   oz  meat   daily

Fasting, on approximately weekly schedule:
- 1 day only herbal tea
- 1 day no food, no water
- 1 day smoothies and shakes

No water: ~8 glasses of herbal tea, usually unsweetened,
but optionally sweetened with fruit juice or milk.
- after waking: usually soaked chia seeds and lemon juice or vinegar
- before bathing
- 30 min before meal(s)
- before sleeping: usually accompanying ascorbic acid or citric acid

Limit the use of the normal staples.
They are spiritually empty and clog the system.
Instead they are used sparingly:
- meat used as a seasoning or condiment, usually in the form of broth and bacon bits
- grains, beans, starches used as a seasoning, such as breading or other filler

Rather than the normal staples,
the alchemical staples are:
- vegetables, predominantly cooked
- seeds such as: flaxseeds, hempseeds, chia seeds
- nuts such as: peanuts, pistacchios, cashews
- fruits such as lemons and cherries
- mushrooms
- acids from citrus and fermented foods

Timing:
- Caffeine, such as coffee, tea and chocolate should be taken early in the day.
- Cherry tea and cherry juice should be taken late in the day.

Foods such as cherries and coffee must have periods of break to reset the tolerance.
