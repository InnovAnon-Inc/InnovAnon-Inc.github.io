## Form of Worship

Worship takes a personal form and is primarily carried out
on a solitary basis, merely being supplemented
by congregational [services]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/services.md %}).

- Developing a [personal relationship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}) with one or more Celestial beings.
- [Transforming]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}) the consciousness to inhabit the Glorified Body.
- [Congregating]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %}) to [pray]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %}) in unison and to partake in Sacrament.
