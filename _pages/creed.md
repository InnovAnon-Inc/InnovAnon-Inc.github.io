Our Creed, elsewhere known as
a Statement of Beliefs or Testament of Faith,
lists key concepts in our mythos.

Our Form of Worship follows from our Creed,
and involves transforming belief into firsthand experience.

## Recognized Creed
InnovAnon, Inc. emphasizes action rather than creed as the primary expression of a religious life;
those actions are guided by certain core beliefs:
- Belief in God
- Belief in Angels
- Belief in the Glorified Body
- Belief in Salvation
- Belief in Heavenly Realms
- Belief in Judgment
- Belief in Prophets
- Belief in Divine Books
- Belief in Miracles
- Belief in the Divine Plan
- Belief in the [Garden of Eden]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %})
- Belief in Armageddon
- Belief in the Kingdom of Christ

The specifics of these beliefs are elaborated in the [doctrines]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link  _pages/doctrine.md %}).

## Form of Worship
Worship takes a personal form and is primarily carried out
on a solitary basis, merely being supplemented
by congregational [services]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/services.md %}).

- Developing a [personal relationship]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}) with one or more Celestial beings.
- [Transforming]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}) the consciousness to inhabit the Glorified Body.
- [Congregating]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %}) to [pray]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %}) in unison and to partake in Sacrament.
