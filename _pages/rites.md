These rituals define specific practices
that progress the personal and [Aeonic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/works.md %}) Great Work.

There are two categories:
- Rites and Ceremonies for Everyone
  + congregational ceremonies
  + solitary rites prior to Continuation of Consciousness
  + solitary rites after Continuation of Consciousness
- Rites and Ceremonies for Priests

## Rites and Ceremonies for Everyone
Regular [congregations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %}) are held to
perform [services]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/services.md %}),
including the unified [prayer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %})
and associated Rites and Ceremonies.

### The Ceremony of the Associate
It is sufficient to merely [propagate awareness](http://www.losethegame.net/) of the Gospel's existence,
progressing the Aeonic Great Work.
It can help to invoke a name, such as InnovAnon,
as it is a unique and effective breadcrumb.

## Rites and Ceremonies for Attaining Continuation of Consciousness
These paint a picture of a day in the life
of the typical practitioner,
and are an intrinsic part of the [Great Work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
necessary for Salvation and Eternal Life.

Various rites and ceremonies are performed at specific times
throughout the day, granting the ability to perform
another series of rites and ceremonies while resting.

Morning Rituals:
- The Dream Journal
- Morning Meditation
- The Rite of the Rising  Sun

Evening Rituals:
- The Rite of the Setting Sun
- The Rite of the Black   Sun

Before Sleep:
- Evening Meditation
- The Silver Key Ceremony

After Sleep:
- Dream Meditation
- Communion with Celestial Beings
- The Elemental Rites
- The Ceremony of Seven Seals

Finally, there is a ritual that is not performed daily:
- The Great Rite

### The Dream Journal
Recording dreaming experiences immediately upon waking helps to enhance dream recall,
and therefore Continuation of Consciousness.

[![Dream Recall](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IRJb9r6Jk8Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRJb9r6Jk8Q)

### Morning Meditation
One of the optimal times to meditate,
increasing its benefits by several-fold.

### The Rite of the Rising  Sun
Sun-gazing Dhyana Meditation at sunrise.
This marks the completion of the morning rituals.

### The Rite of the Setting Sun
Sun-gazing Dhyana Meditation at sunset.
This marks the beginning of the evening rituals.

### The Rite of the Black   Sun
Visualization technique to be performed between sunset and sunrise.

### Evening Meditation
Another of the optimal times to meditate,
followed by the Silver Key Ceremony
and then sleep.

### The Silver Key Ceremony
Reduces the chances of slipping into unconsciousness when trying to enter a trance.
Hold in your hand a metallic object, such a silver key,
while you are meditating or going to sleep.
When you lose consciousness and the object falls,
it should make a sound to awaken you,
so that you can reattempt to enter a deeper state of consciousness
without falling asleep.

This marks the conclusion of the evening rituals,
and the beginning of the sleep ceremonies.

### The Great Rite
The tantrik technologies creates a particularly intense spiritual bond;
it is inadvisable to perform this rite with profane people,
and especially not with several profane people,
except if your particular spiritual training has prepared you for it
(in which case, your specific tradition may require such things).
If the tradition in your spiritual lineage hasn't had you
celebrate a [different sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghori#Medicine)
of Sacrament, then this exception does not apply to you.

Along this vein, it is possible to perform this rite
with somone in a lower phase of attainment than you,
drastically accelerating that person's progress,
but it is not recommended to do this too many times in one lifetime.

Once the minimum required phase of the Great Work is attained,
there is obviously an imperative to proceed to this step,
known as the Great Rite,
but it should only be performed between a Priest and a Priestess.

In the absence of a suitable partner,
it is recommended to use your newly attained [Darshan Siddhi]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %})
to give another meaning to "personal relationship" and
"communion" with the Celestial beings.

This technology causes your brain to release a chemical
known as the Elixir of the Sun,
which, when combined with the Elixir of the Moon,
causes the state of being occasionally referred to as
[the Philosopher's Stone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}).

Regular consumption of the Philosopher's Stone grants longevity,
buying time to pursue Level 4 Ascension.

Procedure for the Great Rite:
1. approximately 10 days celibacy
2. coitus until the brink of climax
3. direct the chi upward from your root chakra
   to your sacral chakra
4. repeat steps 2-3 for each chakra,
   all the way up to the crown chakra,
   and then all the way back down to the root chakra
5. release as prescribed in previous installations of the Bible Trilogy.

Certain moralities have evolved as a result of this ancient technology.
- Rejection of the Covenant of Abraham as a symbol of death.
  The practice is known to interfere with tantrik technologies which grant life.
  Therefore, the practice is associated with death in the canon;
  indeed, it was common among soldiers who swore a contempt for life.
  Furthermore, the practice directly contradicts New Testament Law:
  for a Gentile to perform this so called covenant,
  it is a rejection of God and a sacrifice to Satan.
- Rejection of Sodomy as it perverts the proper flow of chi.
- Rejection of Homosexuality as the Great Rite is not feasible between
  two members of the same gender without some form of sodomy.
  The Priesthood has abstained from canonizing this dogma,
  but the logistical considerations are left as an exercise for the reader
  if that's you're perogative.

## Rites and Ceremonies for once having Attained Continuation of Consciousness
Continued practice of the preceding rites and ceremonies
will maintain and further your [progress]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/siddhi.md %});
the following rites and ceremonies will also further your development,
but their primary purpose is to advance the Aeonic Great Work:
- The Elemental Rites
- The Ceremony of Seven Seals
- The Ultimate Rite
- Summoning a Celestial Being
- Holy Communion

By the time you unlock the ability to perform these rites and ceremonies,
you will have meditated for countless hours.
These rituals break up the monotony of your intensive meditation regimen
and reward your efforts with interesting new experiences.

In fact, a plethura of [sorceries](http://www.firedocs.com/remoteviewing/answers/crvmanual/CRVManual_FiredocsRV.pdf)
are now at your fingertips, though exploring them is neither canonical nor necessary,
as they can distract from the Great Work:
by now, you have the proof you need to continue onward.

### The Elemental Rites
At this level, it is possible to visit the elemental planes in the Lower Heavens.
These must be entered through gateways to these dream worlds,
which are opened by performing Dhyana Meditation
while visualizing specific sigils (in this case, known as Tattvas).
Each of these gateways can be nested to access twenty additional elemental planes.
1. Earth
2. Water
3. Air
4. Fire
5. Spirit/Aether/Akasha

Elemental spirits dwell here.
Extended stay in these realms will attune you to them,
granting control of the elements
and allowing you to reincarnate as an elemental,
though this is neither necessary nor recommended.

### The Ceremony of Seven Seals
The Seven Seals, or chakras, can be unlocked at this level as well;
the procedure is similar to the Elemental Rites.
1. Muladhara:    root
2. Swadhisthana: navel
3. Manipura:     sacral
4. Anahata:      heart
5. Vishuddhi:    throat
6. Anja:         brow
7. Sahasrara:    crown

Extended stay in these realms also grants extraordinary abilities,
and is neither necessary nor recommended.

Having visited the elemental planes
and unlocked the Seven Seals,
it is possible to perform the Ultimate Rite and the Baptism by Fire.

### The Ultimate Rite
At the moments preceding death, perform Dhyana Meditation,
as with the Elemental Rites and the Ceremony of Seven Seals.
Usually a Chaos Star is used as the focus,
as it can help you attain at death a higher Level of Ascension
than you otherwise have attained.

The equal-armed cross is a projection of the Chaos Star
onto two dimensions.
For the Ultimate Rite, you should use a Chaos Star
with the desired number of dimensions,
usually four.

The preceding rites and ceremonies
are merely practice for the Ultimate Rite;
the Ultimate Rite itself should be performed
regularly to ensure its success at the critical,
final moment.

### Summoning a Celestial Being
This ritual is unlocked after having attained the ability
to [commune]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %})
with Celestial beings, and performing the Elemental Rites.

It is not recommended to attempt this
without having contributed to restoring
the Garden of Eden (instead, use the
Elemental gateways).

- While awake, locate a hole in the ground.
  This hole should be natural, but can be of any size.
- While dreaming, return to the hole, and enter it.
  If successful, you will travel down a deep series of tunnels,
  ultimately coming out into another world--a large and natural place.
- In this realm, Celestial beings typical appear as animals.
  Decide which physical form you want it to take,
  and wander about until you find a Celestial being,
  regardless of its form on this plane.
  Bring it back with you when you return to this realm.
- The Celestial being will physically appear after a short time;
  species such as locusts and bees tend to appear in swarms
  (which can be used with the Trial of Classification),
  rather than individual specimens.

This ritual can be repeated, using a succession of manifestations,
expanding your Aeonic consciousness:
- beginning with a few accessible species that you can observe,
  selected each corresponding to a classical element,
- then progressively more ancient ancestors of those species,
  as well as more exotic ones,
- making accessible prehistoric species,
  such as platypus, crocodile, sea urchin, shark or bee,
- and ultimately primordial species.
  Here, spirits will rarely manifest in the same form
  in which you encounter them in the dream worlds.
  For example, a raptor might manifest as jungle fowl--chickens.

### Holy Communion
Perform this rite after having attained the ability
to [commune]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %})
with Celestial beings.

It is possible to use just about any focus for the Dhyana Meditation,
including sigils, candles, mirrors (as with remote viewing)
and even your own reflection:
- perform Dhyana Meditation using your reflection as a focus
- your reflection will morph, no longer reflecting your physical body
- touch hands with your mirror self.
  This is like the union of matter and anti-matter.

There is a variant of this rite that can be used for
the Trial of Classification:
- water instead of a mirror
- the reflection morphs into the target
- usually, more than mere observation is performed,
  given the dynamic nature of the scrying surface.

## Rites and Ceremonies for Priests
The following rituals require a certain level of dedication
to the process of spiritual transformation
as they are involved and time-intensive to carry out.

The first three, in addition to requiring a high degree of spiritual advancement,
require hours of daily practice in addition to the standard set rituals
and possibly even penances.
- The Trial of the Adept
- The Rite of the First Priest
- The Trial of Classification
- Baptism by Fire

A series of rites have been borrowed,
due to their effectiveness.
- The Rite of the External Adept
- The Rite of the Internal Adept
- The Rite of the Abyss
- The Rite of the Grand Master

### The Trial of the Adept
To [qualify]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) for the status of Adept,
a person must perform a miracle before a quorum of Adepts who will verify its authenticity.
This status is irrevocable.

A quorum of Adepts is gathered to observe a miracle and to verify its authenticity.
The one who performs the miracle is officially recognized as an Adept.

This demonstration of insight and ability proves competency in the Divine Sciences
and the completion of the minimum required studies,
qualifying a person for the [Priesthood]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %})

### The Rite of the First Priest
In the absence of such a quorum,
the Adept should demonstrate his ability before a congregation of the highest-level initiates he can assemble.

An Adept may declare himself a Priest and establish his own Priesthood.
That priesthood is recognized as legitimate.

### The Trial of Classification
Having passed milestones such as the Trial of the Adept or the Rite of the First Priest,
the next step is to attempt the Trial of Classification.
Successfully completing this rite qualifies you for Class B or higher,
and marks a cusp of the ages:
the Annointed One will arrive soon after.

It is recommended to attempt the Trial of Classification
during some event such as a meteor shower, hurricane, tornado, etc.,
as you attempt to hurl calamaties upon adversaries of the Great Work.

### Baptism by Fire
Someone attaining the status of Acolyte or higher attends a funeral in his own honor,
merges consciousness with a dying soul and transports it to a different Heavenly Realm
than it would have otherwise gone to. Particularly effective if carried out by an Ascended Master.
