These rituals define specific practices
that progress the personal and Aeonic Great Work.

There are two categories:
- Rites and Ceremonies for Everyone
  + congregational ceremonies
  + solitary rites prior to Continuation of Consciousness
  + solitary rites after Continuation of Consciousness
- Rites and Ceremonies for Priests

## Rites and Ceremonies for Everyone
Regular [congregations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/congregations.md %}) are held to
perform [services]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/services.md %}),
including the unified [prayer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %})
and associated Rites and Ceremonies.

### The Ceremony of the Associate
It is sufficient to merely [propagate awareness](http://www.losethegame.net/) of the Gospel's existence,
progressing the Aeonic Great Work.
It can help to invoke a name, such as InnovAnon,
as it is a unique and effective breadcrumb.

## Rites and Ceremonies for Attaining Continuation of Consciousness
These paint a picture of a day in the life
of the typical practitioner,
and are an intrinsic part of the [Great Work]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %})
necessary for Salvation and Eternal Life.

Various rites and ceremonies are performed at specific times
throughout the day, granting the ability to perform
another series of rites and ceremonies while resting.

Morning Rituals:
- The Dream Journal
- Morning Meditation
- The Rite of the Rising  Sun

Evening Rituals:
- The Rite of the Setting Sun
- The Rite of the Black   Sun

Before Sleep:
- Evening Meditation
- The Silver Key Ceremony

After Sleep:
- Dream Meditation
- Communion with Celestial Beings
- The Elemental Rites
- The Ceremony of Seven Seals

Finally, there is a ritual that is not performed daily:
- The Great Rite

### The Dream Journal
Recording dreaming experiences immediately upon waking helps to enhance dream recall,
and therefore Continuation of Consciousness.

### Morning Meditation
One of the optimal times to meditate,
increasing its benefits by several-fold.

### The Rite of the Rising  Sun
Sun-gazing Dhyana Meditation at sunrise.
This marks the completion of the morning rituals.

### The Rite of the Setting Sun
Sun-gazing Dhyana Meditation at sunset.
This marks the beginning of the evening rituals.

### The Rite of the Black   Sun
Visualization technique to be performed between sunset and sunrise.

### Evening Meditation
Another of the optimal times to meditate,
followed by the Silver Key Ceremony
and then sleep.

### The Silver Key Ceremony
Reduces the chances of slipping into unconsciousness when trying to enter a trance.
Hold in your hand a metallic object, such a silver key,
while you are meditating or going to sleep.
When you lose consciousness and the object falls,
it should make a sound to awaken you,
so that you can reattempt to enter a deeper state of consciousness
without falling asleep.

This marks the conclusion of the evening rituals,
and the beginning of the sleep ceremonies.

### The Great Rite
The tantrik technologies creates a particularly intense spiritual bond;
it is inadvisable to perform this rite with profane people,
and especially not with several profane people,
except if your particular spiritual training has prepared you for it
(in which case, your specific tradition may require such things).
If the tradition in your spiritual lineage hasn't had you
celebrate a [different sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghori#Medicine)
of Sacrament, then this exception does not apply to you.

Along this vein, it is possible to perform this rite
with somone in a lower phase of attainment than you,
drastically accelerating that person's progress,
but it is not recommended to do this too many times in one lifetime.

Once the minimum required phase of the Great Work is attained,
there is obviously an imperative to proceed to this step,
known as the Great Rite,
but it should only be performed between a Priest and a Priestess.

In the absence of a suitable partner,
it is recommended to use your newly attained [Darshan Siddhi]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %})
to give another meaning to "personal relationship" and
"communion" with the Celestial beings.

This technology causes your brain to release a chemical
known as the Elixir of the Sun,
which, when combined with the Elixir of the Moon,
causes the state of being occasionally referred to as
[the Philosopher's Stone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/alchemy.md %}).

Regular consumption of the Philosopher's Stone grants longevity,
buying time to pursue Level 4 Ascension.

Procedure for the Great Rite:
1. approximately 10 days celibacy
2. coitus until the brink of climax
3. direct the chi upward from your root chakra
   to your sacral chakra
4. repeat steps 2-3 for each chakra,
   all the way up to the crown chakra,
   and then all the way back down to the root chakra
5. release as prescribed in previous installations of the Bible Trilogy.

Certain moralities have evolved as a result of this ancient technology.
- Rejection of the Covenant of Abraham as a symbol of death.
  The practice is known to interfere with tantrik technologies which grant life.
  Therefore, the practice is associated with death in the canon;
  indeed, it was common among soldiers who swore a contempt for life.
  Furthermore, the practice directly contradicts New Testament Law:
  for a Gentile to perform this so called covenant,
  it is a rejection of God and a sacrifice to Satan.
- Rejection of Sodomy as it perverts the proper flow of chi.
- Rejection of Homosexuality as the Great Rite is not feasible between
  two members of the same gender without some form of sodomy.
  The Priesthood has abstained from canonizing this dogma,
  but the logistical considerations are left as an exercise for the reader
  if that's you're perogative.

## Rites and Ceremonies for once having Attained Continuation of Consciousness
Continued practice of the preceding rites and ceremonies
will maintain and further your [progress]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/siddhi.md %});
the following rites and ceremonies will also further your development,
but their primary purpose is to advance the Aeonic Great Work:
- The Elemental Rites
- The Ceremony of Seven Seals
- Communion with the Mirror Self

### The Elemental Rites
At this level, it is possible to visit the elemental planes in the Lower Heavens.
These must be entered through gateways to these dream worlds,
which are opened by performing Dhyana Meditation
while visualizing specific sigils (in this case, known as Tattvas).
1. Earth
2. Water
3. Air
4. Fire
5. Spirit/Aether/Akasha

### The Ceremony of the Seven Seals
The Seven Seals can be unlocked at this level as well;
the procedure is similar to the Elemental Rites.
1. Muladhara:    root
2. Swadhisthana: navel
3. Manipura:     sacral
4. Anahata:      heart
5. Vishuddhi:    throat
6. Anja:         brow
7. Sahasrara:    crown

Having visited the elemental planes
and unlocked the Seven Seals,
it is possible to perform the Death Rite.

### Communion with the Mirror Self
Perform this rite after having attained [Darshan Siddhi]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}).
It is possible to use just about any focus for the Dhyana Meditation,
including sigils, candles and even your own reflection,
as in the Rite of the Mirror Self:
- perform Dhyana Meditation using your reflection as a focus
- your reflection will morph, no longer reflecting your physical body
- you may choose to touch hands with your mirror self

## Rites and Ceremonies for Priests
The following rituals require a certain level of dedication
to the process of spiritual transformation
as they are involved and time-intensive to carry out.

The first three, in addition to requiring a high degree of spiritual advancement,
require hours of daily practice in addition to the standard set rituals
and possibly even penances.
- The Trial of the Adept
- The Rite of the First Priest
- The Trial of Classification
- The Death Rite

A series of rites have been borrowed,
due to their effectiveness.
- The Rite of the External Adept
- The Rite of the Internal Adept
- The Rite of the Abyss
- The Rite of the Grand Master

### The Trial of the Adept
To [qualify]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/study.md %}) for the status of Adept,
a person must perform a miracle before a quorum of Adepts who will verify its authenticity.
This status is irrevocable.

A quorum of Adepts is gathered to observe a miracle and to verify its authenticity.
The one who performs the miracle is officially recognized as an Adept.

This demonstration of insight and ability proves competency in the Divine Sciences
and the completion of the minimum required studies,
qualifying a person for the [Priesthood]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/ministers.md %})

### The Rite of the First Priest
In the absence of such a quorum,
the Adept should demonstrate his ability before a congregation of the highest-level initiates he can assemble.

An Adept may declare himself a Priest and establish his own Priesthood.
That priesthood is recognized as legitimate.

### The Trial of Classification
Having passed milestones such as the Trial of the Adept or the Rite of the First Priest,
the next step is to attempt the Trial of Classification.
Successfully completing this rite qualifies you for Class B or higher,
and marks a cusp of the ages:
the Annointed One will arrive soon after.

It is recommended to attempt the Trial of Classification
during some event such as a meteor shower, hurricane, tornado, etc.,
as you attempt to hurl calamaties upon the servants of Satan.

### The Death Rite
Someone attaining the status of Acolyte or higher attends a funeral in his own honor,
merges consciousness with a dying soul and transports it to a different Heavenly Realm
than it would have otherwise gone to. Particularly effective if carried out by an Ascended Master.
