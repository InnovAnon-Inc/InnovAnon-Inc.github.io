Congregations within InnovAnon, Inc. are purposeful gatherings that bring our members together to [pray]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/prayer.md %}) in unison. These congregations are intended to foster a sense of community and spiritual connection.

In keeping with our philosophy of embracing freedom and inclusivity, congregations should be held in free venues that promote a welcoming and accessible environment for all participants. This may include a member's house, a public place, or even the sacred grounds of the [Garden of Eden]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/schools.md %}).

To ensure a sense of intimacy and meaningful engagement, it is recommended that congregations be subdivided into smaller units, known as Prayer Squads, with no more than 13 members per group. The formation of these squads can be self-selected at the discretion of the Priesthood, allowing members to connect with those who resonate with their beliefs and intentions.

Our regular congregations are divided into four categories:
- Esbats (Lunar Calendar)
- Sabbats (Solar Calendar)
- Other Calendar Epochs
- Other Astrological, Ecological or Weather Events

## Esbats (Lunar Calendar)
Esbats are congregations that typically span 1-3 days, with a preference for gatherings at a member's house. These congregations are held in alignment with the phases of the moon, with a minimum requirement of congregating during the full moon. Additional congregations can be held on the new moon and the quarter moons. Esbats provide a sacred time for reflection, prayer, and spiritual contemplation.

## Sabbats (Solar Calendar)
Sabbats are celebratory gatherings that span 2 or more days, ideally taking place within the serene and hallowed grounds of the Garden of Eden. These celebrations are aligned with the changing of the seasons and important astronomical events, such as the solstices, equinoxes, and midpoints between them. Sabbats offer a unique opportunity to honor and connect with the natural rhythms of the world. During these festive gatherings, various regular congregational activities can be incorporated.

By engaging in these regular congregations, our members strengthen their spiritual bonds, deepen their connection to the divine, and engage in shared religious practices that align with the principles and values of InnovAnon, Inc.

Celebrations are held on the solstices, the equinoxes and the midpoints between.
When leaving the campsite, it is imperative that one of Eden's Gardens be left behind.

## Other Calendar Epochs
Certain congregations may choose to align the congregations and celebrations according to the movements of other celestial bodies, such as faraway stars and planets.

## Other Astrological, Ecological or Weather Events
Congregations actively engaging in spiritual warfare may meet during special astrological events, ecological happenings, or extreme weather phenomena for the purpose of influencing the course of these events specifically towards the upliftment of humanity. This may include congregations during meteor showers, thunderstorms, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other climatic occurrences.

Through these diverse types of congregations, our members strengthen their spiritual bonds, deepen their connection to the divine, and engage in shared religious practices that align with the principles and values of InnovAnon, Inc.
