## Regular Congregations
Congregations should be held at a free venue, such as a member's house, a public place or in the Garden of Eden.

### Esbats (Lunar Calendar)
Congregations are held for 1-3 days, usually at a member's house.
At a minimum, congregations are held every full moon.
Extra congregations may be held on the new moon and on the quarter moons.

### Sabbats (Solar Calendar)
Celebrations are held for 2 or more days, preferrably in the Garden of Eden.
Celebrations are held on the solstices, the equinoxes and the midpoints between. When leaving the campsite, it is imperative that one of Eden's Gardens be left behind. During this celebration, any number of regular congregational activites may also be performed.
