Within the Divine Sciences, the field of Applied Spiritual Technologies involves the manifestation of such abilities.
There is a [classification]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/classification.md %}) system for
measuring the degree to which these abilities manifest.

There are ways to temporarily or permanently increase your attainments,
including proper [diet]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/diet.md %})
and alchemy, specific Sadhanas, etc.
In other words:
1. By birth:
   This is part of the hereditary transfer where the spiritually advanced parents transfer their superpowers to their offspring.
   It could also be that one can achieve a superpower because of the things they had achieved in their previous lives.
2. Medicine:
   Superpower can be achieved with certain drugs that have miraculous power.
   In Ramayana, Sanjeevini herb brought Lakshmana back to life
3. Mantra:
   Chanting mantra is said to grant powers to the prayers who chant special mantras in Vedas.
   It is because of the power of those words and the self-discipline that chanting of the mantras can bring.
4. Penance:
   Penance can clarify the mind that one can simply control the five elements by a wish.
5. Samadhi:
   This is achieved when one achieves unity with the consciousness, obtaining extraordinary powers.

There are three main categories of Miraculous Abilities,
which are generally attained in the order which they are presented,
and a fourth category which begins to develop at various points in your journey.
- Continuation of Consciousness
- Communion with Celestial Beings
- The 8 Miraculous Abilities
- The 9 Miraculous Abilities

## Continuation of Consciousness
Also known as Nirvana, Turiya, Moksha or Samadhi,
this state of being grants Continuation of Consciousness,
a lesser form of eternal life that allows some amount of memory and other attributes
to persist when you pass through the Filter between dreaming and waking, between life and death.

This is the proverbial transformation from lead into gold:
the Philosopher's Stone.

This makes accessible to you myriad doors,
such as the Elemental Rites, the Ceremony of Seven Seals
and the Ultimate Rite.

Regular practice of Delta level Dhyana Meditation grants this attribute--this
centering of focus to the state of pure awareness that underlies the cycle:
- waking     (jagrat,   ~16 hrs)
- dreaming   (swapna,    ~2 hrs)
- deep sleep (sushupti,  ~6 hrs)

"He is awake while he dreams."

There are two [rituals]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/rites.md %})
to accelerate progress toward this level:
- The Silver Key Ceremony
- The Dream Journal

## Communion with Celestial Beings
After entering the Dream Level 3,
it is possible to [commune]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/darshan.md %}) directly with the Celestial Beings.
Such communion is commonly known as Darshan Siddhi,
and makes you a prophet in your own right.

The Celestial beings may request that you perform [penances]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/penance.md %})
or even some form of (often personal) sacrifice
to prove your worth (often to yourself).
There is a psychology to sacrifice,
causing priorities to shift
and affecting the way you think about things.

Being rid of attachments is a necessary step for Salvation,
and it is common for Celestial beings to "assist" in that process,
especially at this point.

Vows of poverty and/or silence, etc., may be required at this point.
Even without such vows material blessings may be taken,
so as to unburden you to receive spiritual blessings.

Mantra to be rid of attachments:
"Om Kreem Kreem Kreem Hum Hum Hreem Hreem Daksine Kalike
    Kreem Kreem Kreem Hum Hum Hreem Hreem Swaha"

## The 8 Miraculous Abilities
Otherwise known as the Ashta Siddhi,
the 8 Miraculous Abilities are attributes of a single attainment
which manifests at some point during Ascension.
It is not known which level of attainment is necessary for this phenomenon.
