excerpt: 'Ideas for "Humans are Space Orcs" mythos'
---


humans are a little scary
- Humans are generally mediocre -- in the middle of all metrics
- Humans are basically space orcs... non magical, a little dirtier than most, persistent, but really just another humanoid race. and less orc-y than actual space orcs
- Human dreams are eldritch and affect ftl
- Humans are stupid monkeys that constantly chatter about horrific things
- Earth is a class 12 death world / class 1 garden world
- Humans are probably some sort of sleeper cell for eldritch abominations to enter the universe
- This didn't make humans badass... it just made them take longer
- Milky Way is class 1 garden galaxy
- Andromeda ? is a class 12 death galaxy and has eldritch-descendant void born
- magic mushrooms show indications of genetic modifications and ET origin
- ^^^ ETs evolved from skin flakes of an extra dimensional eldritch
- humans high on magic mushrooms sweat a xeno-safe hallucinagen
- aliens lick humans who are high on magic mushrooms
- humans who enjoy this are banished to system 34
#- Other dimensions have elves, dwarves, magic
#  - magic is causal (as opposed to eldritch), temporarily causes local disruptions in the laws of physics
- (G/S)AIs evolved from cellular genetic neural networks in simulated universes => AIs that don't destroy their universes are given form in this universe
- magic mushrooms => vision from eldritch gods => cooked food => human brain size
- Uncle Creemio's post-scarcity hedonism station on the edge of system 34
- Terran Alliance includes uplifted terrestrial species and SAIs created by them

- humans wear mech suits all the time
- human pets wear uplifting (mainly just speech-enabling with some tactical AR/VR) mech suits
- species-specific cooked food diets => human pets begin increasing cranial capacity
- tend to travel with mecha monkeys, dogs, cats, parrots, horses, sheep, chickens (omg mecha chickens)... mecha barnyard
  - interspecies incidents surprisingly uncommon... for fear of further mecha chicken incidents
- I.T.C.S.S. Shub-Nigurrath
- humans are more likely to side with alien factions than other human factions, except when faced with extinction
- Asteroid belt is a border wall
- some slave-driving species enjoy working with humans because
  - humans build their own cages
  - work long shifts for little more than food or housing
  - call their slave contracts to be "employment" contracts, claiming that the slave-drivers contracts are generally more favorable than those of human corporations, and so they have high morale ... happy slaves
- small species may hire and ride... battle humans. riding on humans is particularly favored by cold-blooded species.
