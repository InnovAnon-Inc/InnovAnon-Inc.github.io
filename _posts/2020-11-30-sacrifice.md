The best     is given life;
the second-best gives life:
we do not eat rotten or sickly fruit,
but nor should we better ourselves
at the expense of others and their progeny
if we can help it.

You love what gives you life;
you give life to what you love:
you must take life, but you must
also ensure that there is life to take.

Hunting   is gathering;
gathering is hunting:
no life is less deserving
of mercy and compassion.

You learn the plants and animals' patterns;
knowing where they will be,
you intervene in their pattern:
you make the decision
either to help or to harvest.

You learn your own patterns.
Fin would say, "shit rolls downhill."
Recognizing this, you are empowered to say,
"the buck stops here."
With wisdom, you have the ability to break
such karmic cycles.

Knowing your food in life and in death
makes your relationship more personal;
it makes their sacrifice more meaningful.

There is more respect--a greater tendency
to use every part of the plant or animal,
rather than discarding husks and carcasses like garbage.
Even the bones might be used for tools,
carried for a long time afterward,
continuously aiding you, even after offering up its life.

Admittedly, there is a certain level of badassery
associated with strutting around the savannah
covered in cat treats, but that just comes with the
territory, being the apex land-based species.

Vegan or not, a free range diet,
hunted/gathered by your own hands,
is the epitome of merciful and compassionate consumption:
too easily-gotten food allows for ungrateful gluttony
and disrespectful waste.

Coming to this land, we did little to learn about the land
before conquering it (the land, specifically).
We imposed our own failing ways upon the land,
bringing with us the same problems we were supposedly fleeing.
We did not observe the ecosystem;
we did not learn what here gives us life,
so we did not appreciate the land.

The separation between man and nature exists only in delusions:
in order to symbiotically coexist with this land,
we must learn it, we must love it, we must harvest its bounty
and, more importantly, we must plant back.

This cycle of hunting, foraging and replanting
is our niche, our sacred duty above all other things,
propagating plants further than they could otherwise,
propagating wild plants that are going extinct because
they only reproduce by human intervention,
and accelerating biodiversity and therefore evolution:
we are catalysts and accelerants for evolution.

This cycle of eating and shitting,
living and dying is what we do naturally.
It's feels good, and it really spreads the berries
all around the hillside, especially when
partaking in the honorable pasttime of hilltop shitting
and sun-gazing.

We are         terraformers and alchemists,
on the cusp of animal       and divine.

Even a single human has world-shaping capacity
when dwelling in the Garden of Eden,
literally shitting entire hillsides of berry bushes,
leaving a trail of edible permaculture instead of
trashed out, barren campsites.

Merely existing in the way that we and nature coevolved to,
a single shitmonkey leaves countless acres of God's Garden
in its wake season after season after season.

That is the circle of life;
that is the meaning of sacrifice.

The sacrament is an intoxicating symbol of this cycle.
Cultures around the world have communed with many things
during their sacramental rites, from
tobacco to alcohol to cannabis to more psychedellic species.

Though all things are sacred in their own right,
these things are set apart and denoted as particularly sacred,
and so orthodox handling of these things is prioritized
even when lacking in other spheres.

It is of utmost importance to partake in the entire circle of life:
planting, growing, harvesting, preparing, offering up to Those on High,
partaking and finally returning it to the Earth.

This is the tobacco offering ceremony of the natives,
a great spirit whose shadow is manifest in the industrialization
of these sacred species, and indeed all things,
such are the fruits of a culture which regards only toilet paper as sacred,
especially during times of crisis.

Deviating from our niche and sacred duty,
our species degenerates,
ruining ourselves and the land.
Our society is at odds with nature and therefore itself,
being an inherent part of nature.

There is a way of life,
and a way of death.

The way of death poisons the earth and ourselves,
and cannot be sustained: it implodes every time.

The way of life is eternal.
