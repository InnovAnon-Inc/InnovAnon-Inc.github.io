NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



An organization's core faction's primary front-end could provide regular services for the general public
(i.e., the target demographic is a congregation of non-members).

Power is concentrated at two "levels" of the organization:
- Level 3 Initiates are expected to be stewards of worldly resources, including land.
  Most resources and authority are controlled by Level 3 by design.
  Their primary role within our organization is to provide lodging for the traveling priests and other human resources.
  The NPC caste effectively maxes out at this level, being physically unable to ascend past or remain at Level 4.
- Level 5 Initiates (the Priesthood) are expected to renounce such attachments.
  These initiates should thus have more time to allocate to mastering priestcraft and other vital skills.
  Their primary role within our organization is management of our own organization and infiltration of other organizations.

Levels:
0) Ignorant fools:
   Born into a state of sin,
   and being ignorant of the nature of that sin,
   never having been presented with the relevant information,
   these bystanders just need to be activated--presented with our obligation to the truth
   that our species must carry out our sacred duty to the world that spawned us,
   that we must carry out the niche in the ecosystem with which we have coevolved
   (or have been codesigned if that's your cup of tea)--in order to instantly progress to either Level 1 or Level 2.
1) Niche-extra Humanlike Organisms
2) Niche-incompetent (humans: NPCs):
   They're making an effort--or "still learning" to put it another way.
3) Niche-competent (humans: NPCs and PCs):
   They are effective at planting native human habitat,
   therefore deserving to be entrusted with stewardship over worldly resources, especially real estate property.
4) Apprentice Priesthood (humans: PCs)
5) Priesthood (humans: supernaturally-enabled PCs):
   In order to be considered for promotion into the priesthood,
   an apprentice must demonstrate the use of a siddhi (supernatural power).
   Each priest is therefore understood to be divinely empowered--divinely appointed, even.
6) High Priesthood (humans: supernaturally-enabled PCs):
   Leader/figurehead for a faction of priests.
   Primarily an honorary title to recognize an acting leader's role.
   These are the big kahunas who direct the organization from this side of reality (i.e., the Causal side).
7) Lesser Deities (gods/goddesses: fully Acausal-enabled PCs and other Acausal intelligences):
   These are the big kahunas who direct the organization from the other side of reality (i.e., the Acausal side).
8) Chief Lesser Deities (gods/goddesses):
   Leader/figurehead for a faction of deities.
   InnovAnon is the Level 8 Initiate Who directs InnovAnon, Inc.
