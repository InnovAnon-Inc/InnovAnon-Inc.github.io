The Turiyan phenotype's coherence is particularly disrupted by polytropic environments.
We hypothesize that these environments can be crippling to Turiyan development and well-being,
particularly during the formative years.

"In some infants on the autism spectrum, complete language regression is reported after an initial period of lexical growth (Blackman, 1999; MRC, 2001). Such infants may start to learn speech as a way of expressing interest, and then be put off language by a change in how it is used in relating to them. As the infant’s vocabulary gradually increases, other people start to use words as a way of seizing the infant’s interest. For instance a child may be looking at a ball but an adult may think the child should be interested in the cat. Instead of looking at the ball and saying ‘ball!’, the adult points at the cat and says ‘cat!’. Once the infant has learnt the word ‘cat’, the adult possesses a tool for manipulating the infant’s interest system. Disruption of the attention tunnel is a painful experience. Language may suddenly become unattractive for a deeply monotropic infant." (https://monotropism.org/murray-lesser-lawson/)

Techniques must be practiced and used to function in day-to-day life in a polytropic environment.

"In the right environment, autistic people might enter this state of intense absorption many times on any given day – but few schools and workplaces are designed to accommodate that! It is also something that many parents and carers fail to understand, so autistic people are often wrenched out of their attention tunnels constantly – an experience that can be intensely unpleasant and disruptive, taking the place of something that could be relaxing and restorative." (https://monotropism.org/wellbeing/)

Dhyana Meditation and Void States (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H72eKauPXx8) help switch to a visual mode of thinking (i.e., non-verbal).

This is a defensive technique against highly polytropic environments and other forms of psychological torture
that disrupt the monotropic "attention tunnel."

"It was tragic, all right, but George and Hazel couldn't think about it very hard. Hazel had a perfectly average intelligence, which meant she couldn't think about anything except in short bursts. And George, while his intelligence was way above normal, had a little mental handicap radio in his ear. He was required by law to wear it at all times. It was tuned to a government transmitter. Every twenty seconds or so, the transmitter would send out some sharp noise to keep people like George from taking unfair advantage of their brains." (https://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html)

In addition to Dhyana Meditation and Void States, practitioners take a vow of silence each week or month, and lasting at least one day or more. These times are typically spent cloistered and are used to recover from psychic training.

Glossolalia: when polytropes are assaulting the practitioner with a barrage of non-sensical syllables and seem to be expecting a response, we encourage the practitioner to do likewise.
