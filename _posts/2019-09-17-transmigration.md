The default goal of human life is to attain Turiya,
the state transcending waking life and sleep, life and death,
and thus begin the process of constructing a self-sustaining Acausal vessel
into which to transmigrate upon leaving this plane.

However, increasingly many Adepts are opting to take rebirth in the Causal plane,
and using certain sadhanas to increase their ability to retain certain aspects of themselves,
including some memories, as they pass through the Filter and take rebirth.

That is, they are achieving some level of continuation of consciousness.
In doing so, they are able to help ensure the continuation of their organization's efforts.
