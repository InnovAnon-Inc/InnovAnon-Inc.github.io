The wealth gap is approaching sufficient levels to cause a golden age of cannibalism.
With any luck, we'll see the first acts within 5-10 years.

It was time to eat the rich a few decades ago.
Now it's time to eat the middle class, too.

If they had any sense of self-preservation,
then they would not have let things come to this point
where it is too late to save themselves.
The middle class desires to be cannibalized.
There is no rational argument against this point.

The intellectuals will partake to make a statement,
but the masses won't know any better:
kuru will ensue.

The people will arrive at this final solution for the problematic members of society.
Whatever system replaces the current one will be well-deserved and well-earned.

In the impending communo-fascist regime, the lower-middle class will foot the medical bills for the demented cannibals--the patriots who saved our country from its current trajectory.

It won't be a substantial change.
It's just the next iteration of the traditional red vs. blue game
we call American politics.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
