NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



So far, we've placed a lot of emphasis on dealing with superhuman and godlike-figures.
However, there is a sort of end-all, be-all called "The Source" or "The One" (as in, literally, the number one).
We'll leave it at that, so as to avoid going into too much woo-woo stuff.
Having an Acausal comprehension of The Source is important at an individual level, 
as this comprehension correlates with one's progression through levels and classes.

There is also this notion of "The Way" by which the The One operates.
Generally, a way is considered synonymous with a program,
but an Acausal Way would, by definition,
have to be beyond what is describable by any causal program.

A way is also considered synonymous with a Dharma;
this is an attempt to exhume the Sanatan Dharma (the Eternal Way).

The One begets The Two (i.e., duality):
- Brahma (i.e., "The Force" or the Cosmic Super Soul)
- Atma (i.e., the individual soul)

This is an Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism) school of Sanatan Dharma,
which means that we believe that the Brahma and Atma are two aspects of the same thing.
