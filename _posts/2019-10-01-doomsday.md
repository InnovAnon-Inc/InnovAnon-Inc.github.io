NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



All it takes is one person with both the desire
and the means to activate such a device,
and then it's game over.
The act itself could be perceived either as an act of ultimate evil,
or even as an act of ultimate mercy.

If you have the desire, but lack the means,
then the thing to do is to induce that desire in others:
try to make that desire reach a critical mass within the population.

"By the End of Kali Yuga, the population of the whole world will... have no power to understand this philosophy, God consciousness. So at that time, when there are no more religious principles, there is no other alternative than to kill them all.

At that time the Kalki avatar will come, and He'll take a sword on horseback, just like a king sent from heaven, He'll simply go on killing all these non-believers, Godless creatures and usher in another Satya-yuga, the golden age of righteousness and truth."
