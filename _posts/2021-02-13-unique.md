The tech industry has been declining since the mid-2010s or earlier.
The pandemic has exacerbated the decrease in job openings.
I got my last tech job offer around 2015 or 2016,
so I assert that there are no tech job openings in this region:
tech jobs are a myth. They don't exist.

InnovAnon, Inc. is the only organization in Texas
attempting to provide productive tasks, food, housing, training, etc.,
to tech experts and those wishing to become tech experts.

InnovAnon, Inc. is a voluntary religious order:
a coder cult with a coding devi.

InnovAnon, Inc. uses its collective tech expertise
to feed the wild.
