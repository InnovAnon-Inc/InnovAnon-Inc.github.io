NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



- Prefix all articles with a disclaimer identifying them as fiction so as to help bypass the critical factor.
- Repeat your thesis and instructions to enhance their memorability.
- Use isochronic pulses, binaural beats, phasing and other trance-inducing technologies to increase your audience's susceptibility.
- Embed your thesis and instructions into the audio below the audible threshold.
- Use present-tense language, as in engineering subliminal affirmations, so as to program the subconscious effectively.
- Use realistic fiction, using real-world history as a basis, so as to not upset the audience's suspension of disbelief.
- Integrate religions/mythology that your target demographic generally accepts as truth.
- Consider how a faction would acquire and maintain global control.
- Integrate narratives based on--or even merely inspired by--factual events.
- Integrate actual anecdotal evidence.
- Use emotionally-charged language, images and audio.
- Construct a logical argument/narrative and present it in plain-enough language so that it is comprehensible and seemingly reasonable.
- Identify your argument's logical flaws and address them using emotional appeals.
- Utilize simple, standard formats for presenting your message.
