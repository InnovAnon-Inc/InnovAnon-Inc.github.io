Controversial topics to be controlled/regulated in civilization
(outside civ, these things must be decided by tribal authorities):
- Abortion            : Permitted for medical purposes or for completion of duty to civilization.
                        If choosing to carry a pregnancy to term, the parent(s) will leave civilization.
                        TODO is it permissible to abort for the purpose of sacrifice or donating to science?
- Animal Rights       : Inside civ, animals are trained to perform services,
  and therefore receive a type of citizenship with certain protections.
  Non-service animals prohibited within civ.

- Black Lives Matter  : Undecided.
- Blue  Lives Matter  : Traditional police abolished.
  Replaced with "police service selection:" basically it's like jury duty.
  This policy probably needs to be updated.

- Copyrights          : Totally abolished: all intellectual property belongs to the nation.
- Currencies          : Must be able to be produced by citizens.
  Preferring: gold/obsidian-based coinage, seeds and (maybe) crypto-currencies.

- Death Penalty       : Replaced with banishment from the nation.
  Once banished, stepping foot within the nation will be a capital offense.
- Democracy           : Probably not.

- Electoral College   : Undecided.

- Free Market         : No. Civ will use the Vedic model.

- Genetic Modification: Undecided.
  Obviously, this will be necessary to compete with other civilizations.
  The question is how to properly roll out technologies that could accidentally genocide a bloodline.
  Forbidden until sufficient precautionary policies are implemented:
  forbidden unless control groups show no adverse effects after some number of generations.
  Permitted for specific (i.e., mission critical) purposes.
- Genetically Modified Mosquitoes, etc.: Capital offense.
- Gerrymandering      : This has already been solved programmatically.
- Global Warming      : Dealing with this is classified as a non-priority,
  though certain policies should reduce it as a side-effect.
  Primary causes:
  - Burning fossil fuels: Capital offense outside civilization
  - Deforestation       : Capital offense, except as necessary for wild tending
- Gun Control         : Not regulated, except possibly for excessively destructive technologies, such as personal nukes.

- Indigenous Peoples  : Restore full hegemony over non-civilized rings.
- Israel/Palestine Conflict and other foreign affairs: Non-intervention.
  If the situation affects us, then obliterate both sides.

- Legalizing Marijuana: Full legalization and deregulation of all religious sacraments for common denominations of major world religions,
  including:
  - Melatonin: InnovAnon, Inc.
  - Alcohol  : Catholicism
  - Marijuana: Shaivism
  - Tobacco  : Indigenous
  - (other psychedelics): Indigenous
- Literacy            : Required for membership in civilization.
- Livable Wage        : Mandatory. Capital offense to disrupt civ by underpaying employees.
  In other words, if a job position is deemed necessary for the functioning of civilization,
  then a person performing that job position must be compensated adequately so as to enable him to remain in civilization to do that job.
  Otherwise, the job position must be abolished and that person should exit civilization.

- Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists: Allocated to different civilizations than, e.g., the communists.
  "Separate but equal."

- Opioids             : Undecided.

- Performance-Enhancing Drugs: Permitted/administered for specific (i.e., mission critical) purposes.
- Plastic Surgery     : Only provided for legitimate medical purposes to treat an illness or injury.

- Relationships       : (including marriage) Not regulated or even registered with the state.
- Religious Freedom   : Total freedom outside civ.
  As much as is reasonable within civ.
  Most civs should probably be secular.

- Sexuality           : Either totally unregulated or completely forbidden.
  This is a non-issue in civ, as all members must be of working age.
- Stem Cell Research  : Either totally unregulated or actively financed and supported.
- Student Loans       : Capital offense to lend with interest.
  National jubilee (periodic cancellation of all debts, usually every 20 years).
  All education necessary for the fulfillment of your role in civilization will be provided/subsidized.

- Taxation and Wages  : Undecided.
  Probably will be completely abolished.
- Terrorism           : Dealing with this is classified as a non-priority,
  though certain policies should reduce it as a side-effect:
  - All activities in civilization will be monitored
    with the primary goal being improving the efficiency of members' everyday lives
    and ultimately improving the civilization's overall productivity.
- The Media           : Undecided.
  In its current form, it needs to be censored and controlled.
- Transgender         : Not prohibited, but not supported.
  No special accommodations made.
  Not covered by Universal Healthcare.

- Universal Healthcare: For members of civilization for the duration of their service.
  Terminally ill or injured members may be ejected from civilization.

- Vaccinations        : Currently prohibited.
  Obviously, this will be necessary to compete with other civilizations.
  The question is how to properly roll out technologies that could accidentally genocide a bloodline.
  Forbidden until sufficient precautionary policies are implemented:
  forbidden unless control groups show no adverse effects after some number of generations.
  Permitted for specific (i.e., mission critical) purposes.
