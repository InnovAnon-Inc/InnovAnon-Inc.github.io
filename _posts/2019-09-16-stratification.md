NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



A strict stratification of the human subspecies is necessary:
- So called, "Player Characters" (PCs)
- So called, "Non-Player Characters" (NPCs)

PCs:
- have an inherent duty to authority over the NPCs.
- They will have teaching and managerial roles in their fields.
- We further divide the PCs into "Levels" and "Classes," meaning their apparent level of acausal consciousness.
- PCs need to speak a language that is unknown to the NPCs.

NPCs:
- require the assistance of PCs for acquiring their narratives.
- According to lore, our ancestors decided that civilization would be possible if we have a slave species,
  so they created these programmable humanoid robots.

A separate axis of stratification based on IQ should be implemented.
- Non-automatable Support Tier: low-skilled jobs for which we don't currently have the technology/resources to automate
- Technician tier:  90-115
- Engineer tier:   116-145
- Researcher tier: 146-200+

These stratifications need to exist outside civilization as well.
For child-rearing and retirement concerns, citizens must exit the civilization,
and are encouraged to form communities with other citizens of their tier.

In order to gain entry into civilization, a citizen must pass an aptitude exam,
which will determine his/her tier, etc.
Upon entering, he/she will register with the Human Resource Allocation Service
which will assign him/her a role in the civilization.

A civilization should have the explicited intention of terraforming and colonizing at an intergalactic level.
It must make tangible advancements toward any of the following fields, lest it be dissolved:
- computing/automation
- space exploration/colonization
- urban/indoor permaculture

A civilization must also maintain peacable relationships with its neighboring uncivilized citizens.

Civilization itself will, as much as possible, follow a Vedic model with a Varna system.
