NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



To mitigate suffering perpetuates the cycle of ignorance and karma:
our universe is finely-tuned to deliver an amount of suffering,
such that a reasonable person will learn his lesson
and that an unreasonable person will simply die off
(i.e., survival of the fittest).

People must bleed--dollars and blood--in order to learn.
It's the only language they understand.
Personal accountability is paramount:
most people will learn nothing from others' suffering.
Stupidity must have a cost--it must be painful.
If there's no personal suffering caused by a person's decisions,
then there is no reason for him to change his actions.

In this regard, exacerbating suffering is arguably virtuous,
as it will increase the rate of learning
and ultimately reduce the number of suffering-causing incidents perpetuated against fellow man
as well as the number of stupidity-related fatalities.

It is important for society, and, indeed, the human genome,
to implement a system to exploit and even punish the less intelligent.
However, this system should be opaque enough
so as to be non-obvious to said less intelligent specimens.
