Our clergy has prescribed that we wear "wizard robes"
for daily use and especially for ceremonial use.
However, this is not strictly required,
and "wizard robes" is not clearly defined.

The concept of a "wizard robe" has various components.  There is always:
- a hood or "cap"
- a knee-length or ankle-length tunic or dress
- some form of apparatus which is generally used for pointing, walking / tenting or other common task, often a:
  - staff
  - wand
  - knife or "athame"
