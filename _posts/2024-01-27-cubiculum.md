Maximize light-proofing and sound-proofing.

Hermetics tend to sleep on the ground,
so it is common to use a tatami mat or camping pad.

The canvas drop cloth serves as an interchangeable floor,
and is used both indoors and outdoors.

A layer of padding may be placed on the mat for comfort,
as well as a layer of cloth to protect the bedding.

Sleep atop the previous layers.
