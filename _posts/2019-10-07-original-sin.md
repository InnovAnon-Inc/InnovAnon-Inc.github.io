NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



There are no "innocent" people living in civilization.



Civilization is inherently evil as it necessitates the subjugation of free peoples,
unsustainable agricultural practices and the destruction of natural ecosystems.

Each of these things necessarily will result in the ultimate destruction of the world,
including the persecution of individuals,
for, as we've mentioned previously,
it only takes a single faction to perpetrate a doomsday scenario,
and any respectable faction will choose death before dishonor,
and a sufficiently extreme faction will choose global obliteration over death.



That being said, all civilized people have inherited the "original sin" of being born into civilization--and all are sinning,
often due to ignorance (except for our readers, for having read this gospel, they can no longer claim ignorance)--and they only way to repent
is to re-wild and to contribute nothing to the civilization or to even actively oppose civilization in a war of attrition.



What amount of personal responsibility should ignorant fools be held accountable for,
especially when that responsibility entails opposing an unstoppable horde
even unto death?

And what of the issue of ignorance?
Is that forgivable in the information age?
Can it even be considered ignorance
when the information is being shouted from nearly all directions?
Or perhaps it should be considered
unforgivable sloth and laziness,
gross negligence,
and complicity by giving an implicit nod of approval?



It is a difficult claim to sell that civilization is inherently immoral,
so I proffer a lesser claim:
that no reasonable person can claim to be blind to evils being perpetrated in our midst.
And so, why are so many so-called "reasonable people" passive, seeing these injustices?
The answer is complicity by complacency.



“He who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.”

― Martin Luther King Jr.
