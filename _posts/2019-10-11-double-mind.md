NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



A symptom of chronic civilization/domestication is the overgrowing of the amygdala in a process known as juvenilization.
Along with this is the development of the double-mind:
a separation of the conscious and subconscious minds which is necessary to shelter a civilized person
from their cognitive dissonance resulting from their subconscious mind
realizing that civilization/domestication is inherently unethical and even destructive--a form of genocide--while
their conscious mind has been conditioned to believe that civilization is somehow necessary and beneficial--a belief
that is contrary to objective and observable fact.

This double-mind is responsible for the attitude-behavior gap:
the discrepency between thoughts, words and actions.

This double-mind is why the typical person has only a negligable amount of self-awareness.

Having been born in captivity and knowing nothing other than civilization,
the conscious mind naturally assumes that civilization is right and normal,
although any rational person can go outside and witness firsthand that this assumption is fundamentally flawed.

This double-mind is what allows the typical person to consciously cling to one belief--that civilization is somehow justified--while,
at a deeper level, knowing that somehow, something is not right about this belief--that 
this belief directly contradicts the empirical data.

This double-mind is what allows the typical person to consciously believe in restorative justice (i.e., Germanic jurisprudence),
but to still practice punitive justice (i.e., Roman jurisprudence).
To actually practice this Germanic jurisprudence,
Americans, for example, would be obliged to become the Indian that our ancestors murdered:
our only way to rectify these atrocities would be to replant their ancestral gardens,
restore native hegemony over this continent,
and to create a good social security system and welfare system that would properly care for elderly natives
without them being obliged to contribute to it in any way,
for the natural order of things is for a healthy person to take care of his parents in their old age.
That is to say that we are morally obligated to treat the natives at least as well as we would treat our own parents in their retirement.

This double-mind is what allows the typical person to consciously know that civilization is currently causing an apocalyptic mass extinction,
but still to do nothing about it--not changing their actions in any significant way.
In a natural setting, this double-mind is fatal:
without an artificial support system to reduce the gravity of their self-defeating behaviors,
natural selection would remove from the genome this overgrown amygdala and its resulting double-mind.

This double-mind is what allows the typical person to consciously know that,
"if I do A, then B will happen,"
and then proceed to do A,
and then act like the victim of circumstance when B happens.

A contrived example of this would be telling a child that touching the hot stove will burn his hand,
and then that child touching the hot stove and wondering why his hand is burning.

The iconic real-world example of this is that
we can tell the masses that continuing along the current trajectory that humans are taking
will result in an apocalyptic extinction.
And, despite having been told this, we can see that the masses are making no substantial effort to alter our trajectory
(for, indeed, this will require abandoning civilization, re-wilding and replanting the ancestral gardens--our
native human habitat that our precivilized ancestors maintained ever since humanity's progenitors terraformed this planet for us).
These same masses will play the victim and wonder why civilization is collapsing around them.

This double-mind is responsible for our collective self-genocide.

On the topic of suicide,
a functioning brain deluded by civilization
will subconsciously pursue suicide,
knowing that persisting in a domesticated state
will continue to cause degeneration in its lineage,
and ultimately cause the destruction of all things.

This is why the typical person exhibits a remarkable contempt for life.

The juvenilization, domestication and civilization of our genome
is clearly responsible for much of the world's suffering.
As such, it is morally incumbent upon us
to put a permanent end to civilization.

Since civilization will always be rebuilt,
an apocalyptic extinction is actually desirable and necessary.
Indeed, our subconscious minds know this and pursue this fate,
while, consciously, we mentally masturbate to some civilized utopia
that could not possibly be attained given our specie's current trajectory.
In fact, our species cannot possibly set itself on the necessary trajectory
without serious changes to the way we currently operate as a species--serious
changes that would require a totalitarian global regime
run by near-superhumans with complete self-awareness and benevolence.

Since all but the uncontacted tribes and re-wilded individuals are actively pursuing,
and, at some level, desire an apocalyptic extinction,
it would be fulfilling their subconscious desire
for a cultist cabal to activate a Global Obliteration Device (GOD).

If you can convince them that the GOD will somehow usure in
a new era--an age of civilized utopia--then
activating a GOD will also fulfill their conscious desire.

Given that civilization will implode without any extra poking or prodding on our behalf,
we need merely focus on removing the support systems our species will need once civilization collapses:
we must destroy all that remains of our native human habitat
so that our species will have no food to forage when civilization does collapse.
As a species, we've been very successful in accomplishing this goal,
and we will have annihilated the last of our native human habitat in very little time.
This will ensure an apocalyptic mass extinction and the extinction of our species.
This will ensure a final end of civilization.

Our emissaries and others are making impressive progress toward this end even as I type.
The ultimate destruction of our species is all but guaranteed at this point.
Now it is up to the individual to attain Acausal existence.
And it is up to the collective to maximize the number of individuals who do attain Acausal existence.

Causal humans will be extinct,
but our legacy will be the Acausal humans
who will watch over whatever species ends up being our successor.
That is, unless we manage to obliterate all species,
thus guaranteeing not only a final end to human civilization,
but a final end to all possible non-human, terrestrial civilizations.

Only time will tell whether we manage to cause the destruction of all species
before our civilization collapses and takes away from us such large-scale destructive means.
