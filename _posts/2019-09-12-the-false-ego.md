As we mentioned in Structuring your Organization,
short-lived cells don't need to have any particular ideology.

"Most of the activity is subversion and agitation.
The goal is to use existing dissidents to fight your wars for you.
You should have as many troll/sock accounts on mainstream social media as you can while remaining anonymous.
They can be [any controversial racial, political or religious faction, etc]."



This is just the tip of the iceberg for your long-lived agents--they should be indoctrinated into some current of O9A-like practices re: insight roles.
Indeed, using troll/sock accounts should have even spiritual/mystical significance,
and the practice should extend beyond the virtual world.

Ideally, your organization will recruit a good number of such agents early on in their careers, so to speak,
so as to minimize the amount of foreshadowing they may reveal about their potential for recruitment into an organization such as yours.
