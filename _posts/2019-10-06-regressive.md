NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



It seems that so many people cling to some perceived "golden era" of civilization,
wishing to go back to that time, in some sort of vacuum and stasis,
so that their nostalgic civilization can be preserved unchangingly.

The true nature of civilization is that it is a living thing
and, as such, it is a growing and changing thing.
Desiring to return to a previous phase of civilization is naive.

Some may even believe that,
if we could go back to some "better time"--to start over, even--then
we could alter the trajectory of civilization's evolution.

Civilization has specific phases through which it must pass.
Merely altering its course to prolong the process does no good for anyone.
Indeed, it prolongs the suffering and exacerbates the necessary bloodshed.



Consider the nature of the contemporary power struggle:
- there are factions striving for world dominance
- extremely minute factions can have global influence
- an imperialistic civilization can conquer an uncivilized nation
- civilization has had over 12 millennia to refine the science of world dominance

This necessitates the existence of a global civilization.
Even a complete re-wilding reset--the total collapse of civiliation--will necessitate reattempting a global civilization:
for, if anyone else reattempts it, then your nation must as well,
lest their bloodline suffer from subjugation.

Civilization itself has a tedious tendency to collapse
and an even more tedious tendency to have "last bastions" and rebuilders:
even returning to precivilization necessitates our progression to a global civilization.



Understanding this natural process--this phenomenon arising from the inherent nature of things--we can consciously use alchemy to shape civilization,
and therefore to shape our own evolution.
Each cycle of civilization is an iteration of the Great Work.
- Dissolution:  Civilization collapses.
- Purification: Individual parts are refined and purified.
  - Brain  Washing:   the "spirit" of things--technology, culture, ideas, religion--is separated and refined.
  - Ethnic Cleansing: the "body" of things--genetics, etc--is separated and refined.
- Coagulation:  Reconstruction of civilization; the refined and purified "spirit" is recombined with the cleansed "body."



The ultimate iteration of civilization will face a total destruction of humanity--the world becoming unable to support our species and our ultimate extinction.
To preserve our species during this final dissolution we can consider the following options:
- retreat underground or undersea
- terraform our planet
- retreat to space 
- repair our ecosystem (if it's not too late)

How we respond during this time will either cause our total annihilation or shape the direction of our future evolution.
