We are experiencing the fourth industrial revolution.
Small businesses are permanently closing.
The pandemic merely accelerated a process that was already occuring.
With the rise of automation, more humans have little to no economic value.

We are currently at the cusp as the largest and wealthiest generation in history
dies off and that wealth is transferred to the first generation to be poorer than
the previous.
Ours is the generation when the decline could be measured on paper.
In our current economy, more than half the population lacks sufficient
economic to sustain themselves and reproduce.
The population is declining.
This is the true unemployment statistic.

UBI is too little too late.
More than half the population is obselete.
Our ancestors forsook our niche,
instead giving life to this failed experiment.
Born in captivity, we are useless to nature.
This experiment--civilization--has matured.
It has outgrown us, and now more than half
the population is obselete--useless to Babylon.

"Late-stage capitalism" is the tip of the iceberg:
this is late-stage civilization.
