NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



During the transition to post-civilization:

- slash and burn warfare is a common tactic used by enemy factions.

- nuclear bombs are detonated in the oceans to cause tsunamis that annihilate coastal civilizations.

- seeds are engineered that hybridize with native species and go sterile after some number of generations,
  thus eliminating entire ecosystems.

- crops are irradiated to eradicate entire populations.

- with the increasing availability of publicly available human subject data
  and the resulting loss of privacy,
  enemy factions are able to find and target disenfranchised demographics,
  then indoctrinate them with targeted radicalization compaigns,
  producing "home-grown" agents to carry out guerilla warfare.  

- psy op campaigns are used to divide enemy civilizations' populations
  to cause social and economic instability

- for wars of attrition, enemy civilizations' politicians
  are funded or otherwise bribed into passing legislature
  that seems inoccuous at first,
  but that ultimately combines with other laws and policies to reduce productivity and economic efficiency.

- compost piles are engineered to combust,
  creating wildfires that hit civilizations and their piplines.

- aquifer recharge zones and wells are poisoned,
  often by concentrating the water a civilization gives its citizens,
  as the water generally contains additives that are highly toxicated
  in concentrated amounts.



After the transition to post-civilization:

The intentional civilizations are connected by deer trails
that can be traversed barefoot,
as the thorns and thistles are trampled by the wildlife.
These trails are generally in the valleys.
Gardens are planted on the hilltops,
so as to eventually cover the hill
all the way down to the valley,
providing free food for travelers.

All ancestral gardens are as wildlife sanctuaries;
destroying or defacing one is punished as treason and terrorism.

Endangered species fortify areas used to contain civilization.
These locations are chosen by go-masters.

Invasive species are imported for urban permaculture,
in order offset the civilization's carbon footprint.
