An organization might support post-human notions, such as dividing the species into three distinct castes, similar to the Spartan model:
  - Niche-extra Humanlike Organisms:
    These humanoids reject their ancestral traditions and shirk their inherent duty to the ecosystem.
    Since they do not fulfill the niche that humans are designed/evolved to fill in their ecosystem,
    they are, by definition, extra and outside of it,
    and therefore are not a part of nature and subsequently are arguably not truly human.
    It's possible to move up from this caste by merely acting as an integral part of nature,
    much in the way that literally every other species does.
  - "NPCs":
    These humanoids lack an inner monologue, which is popularly believed to be necessary for authoring one's own life's narrative.
    They are essentially robots, needing to be programming.
    It's possible to move up from this caste;
    some say it is done by performing sadhanas and dhyana meditation,
    and some say that it is done by comprehending advanced mathematics and physics.
  - "Player Characters":
    True, fully-fledged humans.
