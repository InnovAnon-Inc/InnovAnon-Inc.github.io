NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



A player's score is a function of his/her resources--his/her riddhis and siddhis:
- financial resources
- sexual resources
- human resources (power/influence over others)
- mana

Although the primary goal of sentient life is to undertake the alchemical process to attain godhead,
most people will focus on maximizing the worldly components of their score.
As such, strategizing against such players will involve maximizing financial damages as well as loss of human resources.



There is always going to be a player faction that is "winning," per se.
The other factions, obviously, are playing at a disadvantage
(i.e., they are playing the game with asymmetric board position).

Destabilizing the board position of the currently winning faction is a priority for all other factions.
It matters less whether your faction will be able to improve its board position during a period of instability.



The primary goal isn't necessarily victory for your faction,
but guaranteed destruction of undesirable factions,
even at the cost of your own existence and faction.

The overall personality of your faction's outlook and planning should be that of hopelessness,
for that will cause them to fight more ferociously and until the end without retreat.

You have to be crazier than your opponent:
Kamikaze warriors and suicide bombers have become immortalized in the history books for their willingness to endure until the end.
A faction that is willing to activate a doomsday device would be an intimidating and worthy opponent.
If our civilization continues on its current path, then such a doomsday device would merely accelerate the inevitable,
thus necessitating all that we have outlined in this article.



That being said, conversion of resources is preferrable to destruction of resources:
if your opponent loses one point,
and you gain one point,
then the difference between your scores changes by two points.

Reallocate your opponents assets and reprogram their NPCs.
Set their PCs on the path to assisting in your endeavors.

Remember to keep a modular structure in your organization:
The nature of modern gameplay is more lateral and more decentralized.

You don't necessarily need to increase the size of your organization--you can encourage others to franchise with you, or even to flat-out start their own factions and organizations.
