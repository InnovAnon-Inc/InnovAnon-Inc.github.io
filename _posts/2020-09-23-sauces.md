There are a few main ways to form an emulsion,
and so to base a sauce,
and many variants pair well together:
- Vegetables, as in the eternal stock recipe, or even tomato gravy
- For that matter, cream gravy
- Roux
- Eggs, as for Hollandaise
- Cream, as for a cheese soup or alfredo
- Nuts, e.g., peanut butter becomes peanut sauce
- Seeds

Thicker sauces coat bites of food more densely,
affecting decisions such as noodle type,
bite size of solid chunks, etc.

When properly emulsified, liquids, including fats and oils,
won't separate from pureed solids,
preventing, e.g., greasy lips.

Food is most delightul when it is a combination of textures,
and distinct flavors.
For example, sauce and pasta and meatballs.

Even a simple dish, such as potato soup
might consist of a eternal potato puree,
swirled or mixed with a cream base,
and served with cubed or julienned fried potatoes
thrown into it.

Gravy, for example, should have spicy sausage,
sweet, crispy bacon, and salty dried beef.
The meats and garlic are smothered in pepper and browned well,
the flour is browned well,
and the milk is thoroughly boiled.
It can be swirled or mixed with a cream base.
Served with sourdough.
It is reasonable to vary the consistency
from very thick (as for using as a filling for the sourdough)
to fairly soupy (if there is a lot of meat or bread).

Fruit peels may suffice as a chewy and fiberous
counterpart for a sauce.
