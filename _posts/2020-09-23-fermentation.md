This is an anaerobic process,
meaning you don't want any air (specifically oxygen)
getting into the vessel.
However, this will still work with suboptimal setups.

To have the highest chance of success,
your fermentation is done on a small scale first,
to create a mother of wine.

It is easiest to create a ginger bug.
Use raw ginger peel and water, which you
add gradually at least daily.
When it starts to bubble,
it is ready, and it can be fed
ginger tea, roasted ginger broth,
honey, etc.

These wild-caught bugs will have different qualities,
such as flavor, fermentation speed and strength, etc.
It is good to keep at least one known good specimen,
while you search for new bugs which outperform
your current one in some sphere.

Once a healthy ginger bug has been established,
it can be used to start just about anything with sugar:
- strain as much juice as you can out of any solids
- throw the juice and solids into a container for about a month

Strain out the solids after the halfway point.
Earlier is fine, so about two weeks.
If you're making a spagyric elixir,
then go ahead and calcinate these.

As they eat the sugar, the yeast produce
little bubbles of carbon dioxide
rising up from whichever region
your specimens prefer to dwell.
They also excrete various alcohols.

Toward the end of the ferment,
the production of bubbles slows down,
indicating that the yeast are either
starving from lack of food (sugar) or dying from toxic levels
of their excretions (alcohol) in their environment.

Once the yeast are pretty much dead,
it's time to move on!
If the yeast are completely dead,
then there's nothing protecting your food from contaminants.
But if they're not dead enough,
then the next stage becomes explosive.

Strain everything again to remove the yeast corpses.
If you're doing spagyrics, calcinate them, I guess.

Rebottle into a sterile bottle,
and store in a cool, dry place for 6-24 months.
If the yeast are too active at this point,
then you need to try to burp the bottle
without introducing any contaminants.

At this point, there are a couple things you could do:
- get drunk
- make vinegar
- get drunker

At this point, the concoction is potable,
if that's your prerogative.
The variants of ginger mead,
including the second iteration of the fire potion,
will send you to the abyss with maybe a pint-sized dose.

Making vinegar is an aerobic process,
meaning open up your wine,
so some bacteria can move in,
feast on the alcohol,
and ultimately excrete vinegar.
Bonus points if you get vinegar eels.

Distillation involves extracting the ethanol,
and leaving behind the
methanol, isopropyl alchohol, solids, etc.

Spagyrics extend the distillation process
by calcinating the solids, and
recombining them with the ethanol
to create an intoxicating
alchemical elixir of
purified body and spirit.
