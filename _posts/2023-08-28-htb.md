Basic process:
- Create AWS EC2 instance for CA, LDAP
- Create key/crt/chains
  - Root CA
  - Intermediate CAs for servers and users
  - VPN key/crt/chain and user key/crt/chain
- Create AWS Lambda function for DDNS
- Create AWS EC2 instance to host CRL
- Setup AWS Client VPN endpoint to connect to RDS
- Setup AWS RDS for LDAP, msf database
- Setup docker/LDAP 
- Create HTB team

UPDATE:

AWS free tier does not include RDS/VPN/VPC, etc.,
so we're back to running things in docker.
It's quicker and easier anyway.
Their online console leaves something to be desired.

## TeamHack Project Suite
Penetration testing support infrastructure
for Hack the Box

### Core Infrastructure

- [DDNS](https://InnovAnon-Inc.chickenkiller.com)
  - We are using residential networks and personal computers

- [![CA](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/CAREST/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/CAREST)
  - There is no authority higher than InnovAnon, so we need this

- DB: postgre
  - MSF will use this backend

- [![PPA](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/ppa/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/ppa)
  - Binary packages to simplify installation and maintenance of the
    specific tools we are using.

- [![syslog](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/pgrsyslog/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/pgrsyslog)
  - Centralized syslog.
  - All other machines need syslog rules for logging to this server.
  - This server uses the PG backend.

- [![bash](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/bash-syslog/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/bash-syslog)
  - Bash history => syslog => postgre.
  - We monitor our team. For posterity.

- [![slapd](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/pgldap/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/pgldap)
  - TODO how to use this now that I set it up?

- [![TeamHack DNS](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/teamhack_dns/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/teamhack_dns)
- [![TeamHack DB](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/teamhack_db/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/teamhack_db)
- [![TeamHack REST](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/teamhack_rest/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/teamhack_rest)

- TODO
  - file sharing
    - NFS
    - Samba
    - http/ftp/rsync
  - memcached?
  - chat
    - private IRC
    - public IRC bridge
  - PXE?
    - => customize OS images to contain our tools and configurations out-of-the-box
  - CRM?

### Development Stack

- ACNG
  - docker => needs more cache

- Redis
  - Remote storage backend for ccache

- [DCC](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/dcc)
  - We're gonna have a few different instances -- for different toolchain versions.
    - [![kali](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/dcc/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/dcc?branch=kali)
    - [![ubuntu](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/dcc/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/dcc?branch=ubuntu)
    - [![voidlinux](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/dcc/actions/workflows/pkgrel.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/InnovAnon-Inc/dcc?branch=voidlinux)
  - This uses DISTCC_CMDLIST to enable server-side ccache. Because Docker.
  - Public-facing projects should be compiled using GitHub Actions,
    but exploits, malware and other "one-off" compilations will be done "locally."

### Network Stack

- VPN Client 1
  - Connects to, e.g., ProtonVPN

- TOR or proxychains
  - Connects to VPN Client 1

- VPN Client 2
  - TODO
  - Uses TOR socks5 proxy
  - Connects to HTB

- Site-to-Site VPN Servers
  - BYO Hardwarez: >1 team member => multicluster.
  - TODO
