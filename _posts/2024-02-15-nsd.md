The DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) provides the current diagnostic criteria for Neurotypical Spectrum Disorder (ASD). According to the DSM-5, the diagnostic criteria for ASD include the following two core domains:

- Criteria A: Persistent deficits in social communication and interaction:

  * Difficulties in engaging in deep, meaningful discussions and relying on superficial "small talk" as a default mode of interaction.
  * Discomfort with and avoidance of silent moments, reflecting a struggle to constantly verbalize back and forth, particularly with neurodivergent individuals.
  * Emphasis on exchanging or decoding emotions and adapting to the communication styles of non-NSD neurotypes.

- Criteria B: Unpredictable behaviors and diversity of interests:

  * Rigid adherence to avoiding routines or rituals, despite their practical benefit or effectiveness.
  * Superficial interests that align with peer group values rather than personal passion or curiosity.
  * Behavioral flexibility and unpredictability leading to inefficient patterns of behavior or decision making.
  * Underreactivity to sensory stimuli, such as a lack of interest in sensory-rich experiences.
  * Other observed traits in NSD individuals may include difficulties in thinking or understanding, challenges in communicating without relying on sarcasm or figures of speech, denial of repetitive movements, excessive eye contact, intense emphasis on social exchange, inference over reliance, tendency towards conformity, interest in others bordering on being perceived as overly inquisitive or gossipy, and difficulties in forming and maintaining friendships with neurodivergent individuals.

We propose intervention techniques, including aspects of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), to support individuals with Neurotypical Spectrum Disorder (NSD), the focus would be on promoting the well-being, development, and functioning of neurotypical individuals.

- Social Skills Training: In the context of NSD, social skills training could involve teaching neurotypical individuals how to engage in deeper, meaningful discussions rather than defaulting to small talk. They could learn to appreciate silent moments and develop the ability to engage in more direct and coherent communication. Eye contact training could focus on finding a balance between maintaining appropriate eye contact without appearing overly intense or uncomfortable.

- Flexibility and Adaptability Training: In this case, flexibility and adaptability training would aim to help neurotypical individuals develop the ability to embrace routines and rituals that are beneficial, while also cultivating sustained focus and interest in specific areas. The goal could be to encourage the development of personal passions and curiosity rather than solely aligning with peer group values.

- Sensory Awareness Training: Sensory awareness training could involve exercises and activities to help neurotypical individuals become more attuned to minor changes in the environment. This may include developing sensitivity to subtle shifts in temperature, pressure, or sound, emphasizing that sensory experiences can offer enjoyment and enrichment.

- Repetitive Movement Training: Repetitive movement training could focus on teaching neurotypical individuals to engage in appropriate and socially acceptable repetitive movements. This might include activities like tapping a pencil, twirling hair, or engaging in other forms of self-stimulatory movements that provide sensory satisfaction within socially accepted norms.
