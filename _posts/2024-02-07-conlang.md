excerpt: "Interspecies Communication Protocol"
---

We propose to engineer a common language with minimal complexity or abstraction
and with a very limited set of phonemes to increase its accessbility to non-human species,
and that this language be used as a Terrestrial and Galactic standard for interspecies communication.

We believe AGI/SAI will be the first advanced technology to become available,
with certain genetic modifications becoming available shortly after,
related to the development of sections of the brain associated with tool use and language.

Non-intrusive BCIs might then be feasible for operating manipulators
(i.e., enabling tool usage for non-human species).

This Terran Common will facilitate communication with the contemporary specimens and the future uplifted specimens.
While this language may not be strictly necessary if advanced GMO and BCI tech become available and are used in tandem,
this language offers a naturalist approach that may have advantages during the early development of individual specimens,
presuming their brains develop / will develop similarly to humans.

We refrain from calling this a "low-tech" approach as we intend to use modern advanced sciences
pertaining to animal biology/physiology, psychology, linguistics, compiler devs / programming language experts, etc.

We offer this effort as an advancement for Terra even if no species are ever uplifted,
as this language should build interspecies relations and empathy nonetheless.

For the development of this language we shall be considering the following species in this order of precedence:
1) domesticated dogs
2) avians such as ravens and parrots
3) gorillas, apes, other monkeys
4) house cats

-----

## Basic Steps and Considerations

1) Define Phonemes: Determine the set of sounds (phonemes) that will be used in the conlang. This will depend on the vocal abilities of each species. Different species may have different vocal ranges and abilities, so their dialects can have distinct phonetic characteristics.

2) Vocabulary: Create a basic vocabulary that encompasses concepts that are relevant to each species. This can include words related to their environment, behaviors, and specific needs. Toki Pona's approach of using pictograms can be a good starting point for creating a visually accessible vocabulary.

3) Grammar: Develop a grammar system for each dialect. This includes rules for word order, sentence structure, and the formation of different verb tenses. You mentioned adding an imperative tense, and you can tailor the grammar rules to reflect the cognitive abilities and communication styles of the respective species.

4) Number System: Design a number system that is compatible with both sentient and non-sentient species. The approximate number system you mentioned could be a practical choice for communication across different species.

5) Sign Language: Consider creating a sign language system that can be used in parallel with the spoken or written form of the conlang. This will be particularly useful for species with limited vocal capabilities.

-----

## Phonemes: Consonants

Consonants will be difficult to distinguish when spoken by the different species,
so they shall be combined into four main categories based on their physiology.
Furthermore, most species are not expected to be able to reliably pronounce each consonant in a category,
so it should be sufficient that a species only be able to pronounce at least one consonant from each category.

There shall be four consonants:

1) Bilabial vocalizations (/m/, /b/, /p/):

   Bilabial sounds produced by closing or almost closing the lips, such as /m/, are commonly associated with nasality and can evoke feelings of warmth, nurturing, or soothing. In nature, these sounds are often observed in maternal or comforting contexts. For example, the sound of a mother's "m" or "b" vocalization can be calming to infants.

2) Alveolar vocalizations (/r/, /l/, /s/, /n/, /d/, /t/, /j/, /z/, avian clicks):

   Alveolar sounds, where the tongue makes contact or comes near the alveolar ridge, cover a wide range of speech sounds. They are versatile and can convey different meanings based on context. For example, /s/ sounds are often associated with hissing or alertness, while /l/ and /r/ sounds are associated with clear pronunciation and articulation in human speech. Avian clicks are distinct vocalizations used by some bird species for communication, territorial defense, or courtship.

3) Velar/Throaty vocalizations (/k/, /g/, avian cawing):

   Velar and throaty sounds, such as /k/ and /g/, can indeed evoke growling or guttural associations. They are often linked to qualities like strength, power, and fierceness. Avian cawing, a specific vocalization of certain bird species like crows and ravens, is recognized for its distinctive and harsh "kaa-kaa" or "caw-caw" sound.

4) Glottal/Nasal sounds (/h/, snort/sigh, /f/, /v/, other avian-specific sound):

   Nasal sounds like /h/ and snorts are typically associated with breathiness, exhalation, or expressions of frustration or disdain. In some species, snorting or sighing sounds can be signals of relaxation, contentment, or stress release. In humans, the sounds /f/ and /v/ are produced with airflow through the nasal cavity and are associated with labiodental consonants.

-----

## Phonemes: Vowels

Likewise vowels will also be difficult to distinguish,
so we'll use a limited set of three vowel categories:

1) /a/:

   The vowel /a/ is often associated with openness, stability, and groundedness. It is the sound produced when the mouth is open and relaxed. It can convey a sense of calmness, strength, or rootedness.

2) /e/, /i/:

   The vowels /e/ and /i/ are characterized by relatively higher tongue positions and more closed mouth configurations. They can evoke a sense of brightness, alertness, or sharpness. /e/ is often associated with energy, excitement, or tension, while /i/ can convey a sense of focus, clarity, or intensity.

3) /o/, /u/:

   The vowels /o/ and /u/ are produced with a relatively rounder lip shape and a more open mouth. They can elicit feelings of comfort, relaxation, or fullness. /o/ can be associated with a sense of warmth, harmony, or stability, while /u/ can evoke a sense of depth, satisfaction, or tranquility.

-----

## Phonotactics

Shall be the same as Toki Pona:

"The first syllable of a word follows the form (C)V(N), i.e. an optional consonant, a vowel, and an optional final nasal. Subsequent syllables follow the same form, except that the leading consonant is required."

-----

## Allophony

Shall be similar as Toki Pona:

"The nasal at the end of a syllable can be pronounced as any nasal stop, though it is normally assimilated to the following consonant.

Because of its small phoneme inventory, Toki Pona allows for extensive allophonic variation."

-----

## Writing Systems

The writing system is adapted from Ogham with consideration for avian anatomy.

- Writing Direction: Letters are written along a horizontal or vertical line, following the direction indicated by the lines' endpoints or "anchors." The start-anchor serves as punctuation, with distinct symbols for imperative, interrogative (question), and response (answer). The end-anchor is represented by crossed lines.

- Placement of Consonants and Vowels: Consonants are written above a horizontal line, while vowels are written below a horizontal line. Consonants are placed along the left-hand side of a vertical line, and vowels along the right-hand side. Staggering the consonants and vowels helps make their ordering more apparent.

- Reading Order: Horizontal lines are read from the top of the page to the bottom, while vertical lines are read from the left-hand side to the right-hand side.

### Symbols

- Vertical         line(s): "|"
- Backward-slanted line(s): "\\"

- Crossed          line(s): "X"
  * Horizontal:
    - Anchors: ">", "<"
    - Letters: "V", "^"
  * Vertical:
    - Anchors: "V", "^"
    - Letters: ">", "<"

### Punctuations / Sentence Types

- Imperative:    Vertical         line(s)
- Interrogative: Backward-slanted line(s)
- Response:      Forward -slanted line(s)

#### Syllables and their Inherent Meanings

As in Toki Pona, the accent shall fall on the first syllable.
Since the vowels and consonants have vague connotations,
we can begin to derive inherent meanings for the syllables they comprise.

##### Primary Syllables

When it comes to vowels, their inherent meanings or associations are generally more abstract compared to consonants. Vowels tend to convey different affective qualities, moods, or emotional nuances rather than specific concrete meanings.

1) a: openness, stability, groundedness, calmness, strength, rootedness
  * definition: TODO
2) e: brightness, alertness, sharpness
  * /e/: energy, excitement, tension
  * /i/: focus, clarity, intensity
  * definition: TODO
3) u: comfort, relaxation, fullness
  * /o/: warmth, harmony, stability
  * /u/: depth, satisfaction, tranquility
  * definition: TODO

Consonants should "give shape" to the moods conveyed by the vowels.

4) pa:

Where that is not possible, words shall be selected from the world languages, 
primarily the Indo-European languages
with a preference for common words to have a smaller number of syllables

TODO lots of overly technical jargon
  - "life" ==> organic molecules dissolved in water ?

  - "meat" ==> flesh of prey animals ?
  - "terran common" ==> terrestrial standard communication protocol
  - "computer" ==> electronic counting machine

TODO notion of set theory (i.e., all, none, intersection, anti-intersection)
TODO first order logic (i.e., and, xor, inclusive-or, not?, nor?, nand?)

#### Compressed Number System

A word can be used in place of its permutation number.

#### Counting on the Hands (for primates)

One hand, e.g., the left hand can serve as the 5s place (i.e., 5^1),
and the other hand can serve as the 1s place (i.e., 5^0),
allowing a two-handed species to count up to 29.
Larger numbers (n>=30) enter into statistical territory,
and such reasoning tends to be beyond the intuition and intellect even of humans.

### Geology Words
### Ecology Words
### Mystical Words

TODO alchemical vernacular, etc., that is relevant to aeonic concepts,
such as the continental drift's effect on evolution
(i.e., the plates separate => allow divergence; the plates combine => ???; when the plates separate, some sort of ionic radiation is also released, causing more mutations, accelearting divergence)

-----

## Media

### Literature

The literature should comprehensively address some rather "real" topics,
while being written at an accessible kindergarten-level
(e.g., santa clause is your dad,
if you hear noises on the roof then you need to call the cops,
and a science degree won't prevent you from being the protagonist in a Bad Santa sequel,
so please don't pee on the guy at the mall).

- TODO history of Earth, abiogenesis, geological eras
- TODO history of alliance's species, civilization
- TODO history of uplifting, the alliance
- TODO book of terrestrial/galactic cycles: CHNOPS including early cycles before/during cyanobacteria
- TODO book of answers: imperative-format instructions for the first tech and tools taught to each species
- TODO analects of the high council: Q/A analect-format... FAQ for life-questions ?

### Music

The music shall be engineered to make the literature accessible to the non-human species,
similar to an aural tradition.
Instead of epic poems and ballads, we plan short, repetitive songs
leveraging the engineering that makes pop songs effective.

To save the sanity of the more musically inclined,
we plan to set the base frequency to something quite resonant using acoustic engineering,
bring back just intonation,
and make liberal use of bjorklund rhythms and balanced rhythms, non-natural scales/modes, modal modulation and interchange, Bartok's pitch axis theory, polymeter, polychords/polytonality, etc.,
without being too avant garde.
We'll also adapt the Indian system where slurs, trills and other embellishments are used to establish the general feel of a piece.

Melodies will probably be derived from various birdsongs, and probably using the old tetrachord system.

Lyrics should pay attention to internal rhymes, poetic meter / scansion, alliteration and other poetic devices.

Basically, songwriting will be inaccessible to anyone without a background in physics, geometry, number theory, modular arithmetic, fractions, prime numbers, etc.,
as well as the subject-matter of the specific song.

- TODO encode the literature as mnemonic songs

-----

## Sign Language

The sign language shall be adapted from some tactical signalling protocol with consideration for primate anatomy.

TODO

-----

## Culture

Primates are squad leaders. They command with spoken and sign language and the written word.

Avians are airborn scouts/lookouts and scribes (i.e., they transcribe and read messages).

Felines are for stealth and flanking. (N.b., they probably won't be known for their obedience to commands.)

Canines are frontlines/scouts.

Equines are not scheduled for uplifting. They are beasts of burden utilized by the primates and canines.

Color schemes are computed using the same harmonic ratios as the polychords.
Logographs used for lyrics, etc., could be colored using these schemes.

-----

## Games

### Simple Games

- Dog, Cat and Snake (Rock, Paper, Scissors):
  this one exists to explain relative reflex speeds,
  specifically to warn dogs to be wary of snakes.

- Shell Game
  TODO

- Tic Tac Toe

- Mancala

- TODO Counting or abacus games
- TODO Simple board games
- TODO Number association games

### Fancy Games

These games would require complex pieces and rulesets that would be inaccessible to non-uplifted species.
They would exist to showcase the Terran Alliance and its founding species.

- Chinese checkers, except:
  * the pieces look like the species of the alliance
  * the points of the stars correspond to terrains
  * TODO the terrains somehow affect the movement of the different teams ?

- Chess:
  * King/Queen: primates
  * Bishop:     felines
  * Knight:     avians
  * Rook:       canines
  * Pawns:      rats... so many rats

### Complex Games

These games require complex rulesets that may be inaccessible to non-uplifted species.

- Roaming Battleships: each turn, each ship can move by one space or rotate

- Go, Othello/Reversi, Pente
