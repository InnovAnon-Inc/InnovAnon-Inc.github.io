NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



Wetworks units probably don't even need technician-tier intelligences.

Short-lived, disposable units can be sourced from e.g., the drug-addicted demographic of your local slum.
These don't need to be adept operatives:
provided that they're anonymously sourced,
they can carry out quick and dirty executions,
such as the classic shank-from-behind-at-the-public-urinal.

Long-lived, valuable units can be from higher tiers of intelligences,
but their primary focus in day-to-day life should be maintaining Olympian-level athletic and combat abilities
and, obviously, being proficient at using your organization's technologies.
They should be reserved for defense of the inner circle
and occasionally used for precision (counter-)attacks.

Wetworks units should be equipped with disposable technologies.
- anonymously sourced traditional weaponry is an obvious choice
- improvised devices are becoming increasing popular,
  including lethal projectiles, incendiaries, explosives and even more exotic contraptions, such as lasers, electricity, plasma and railguns
- hand-to-hand combatives remain a relevant sphere of study as well
- Some members of the priesthood may be known to have combat-relevant siddhis,
  similar to, e.g., the Xaolin monastic order.
  Although notably ancient technologies, we consider them to be "unreliable for production use."



One thing to consider is:
- How long-lived must a field agent be in order to justify your expenses/effort in training and realigning his/her paradigm?
