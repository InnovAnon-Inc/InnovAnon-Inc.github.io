Banana peels and other fruit peels can be used for their fiberous texture:
- use a fresh, even slightly green banana
- boil, but not too much
- use in a recipe that can account for the lingering banana flavor

Older banana peels can simply be tossed into smoothies with the rest of the banana.

Harder peels, such as mangoes, can be pickled and ultimately eaten.
