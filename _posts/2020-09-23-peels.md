Banana peels and other fruit peels can be used for their fiberous texture:
- use a fresh, even slightly green banana
- scrape off any residual banana meat
- shred or slice into reasonable sizes
- boil, but not too much. ~10 minutes
- use in a recipe that can account for the lingering banana flavor

Older banana peels can simply be tossed into smoothies with the rest of the banana.

Harder peels, such as mangoes, can be pickled and ultimately eaten.

Use the zest from lemons and limes for peppercorn blends.

Avatar Soup:
They served something like this at the yoga camp,
except I didn't see anyone take it to the next level
with the banana peels.
Basically:
- make onion soup
- add banana peels within the last 10 minutes
