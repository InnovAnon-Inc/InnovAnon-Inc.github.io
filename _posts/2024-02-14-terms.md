excerpt: "Dictionary of terms aimed at fostering a better understanding of the perspective and experiences of neurodivergent individuals."

They [the Equestrian faction] informed us that the original human species, referred to as "adam" or homo sapiens originalis, played a crucial role in transforming the Earth into a habitable environment, often likened to the concept of the Garden of Eden.

According to their account, modern humans, known as homo sapiens domesticus, are the result of a hybridization between adam and another species called "eve" or homo sapiens infernus. It is speculated that eve may have been genetically modified with alien DNA. This hybridization may contribute to the belief held by modern humans that they are separate from and superior to the natural world.

However, the behavior of modern humans seems to deviate from their ecological role or "dharma," resulting in the collapse of entire ecosystems and the ongoing sixth mass extinction. This has led to the metaphorical concept of "the fall" or being "cast out" of the metaphorical Garden of Eden.

We are a distinct [ethnic group](https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Asperger%27s_as_an_ethnic_group).

## NDs vs. NTs

- PCs vs. NPCs: Player Characters
  * Fictional counterpart: Protagonists or main characters in role-playing games, often portrayed with exceptional abilities or attributes.
  * Real-life counterpart: Neurodivergent individuals who may possess a unique set of strengths and challenges due to their neurodivergence.

- Min-Maxers vs. "Normies":
  * Fictional counterpart: Min-maxers are PC players who optimize their character's attributes to maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses.
  * Real-life counterpart: NDs, including individuals with savantism, who may outperform NTs in certain areas while underperforming in others.

- Protagonists vs. "Extras":
  * Fictional counterpart: Protagonists are the main characters in stories, often driving the narrative and overcoming challenges.
  * Real-life counterpart: NTs (Neurotypical individuals), who outnumber NDs by a large margin, tend to blend into the background like movie extras, while NDs may stand out due to their atypicality.

- Jedis vs. Stormtroopers (from Star Wars):
  * Fictional counterpart: Jedis are portrayed as skilled and wise warriors with a deep connection to the Force. In this analogy, NDs can be likened to Jedis, with their unique abilities, which could be seen as a form of high-tech wizardry.
  * Real-life counterpart: NTs, on the other hand, can be compared to Stormtroopers, who are often portrayed as conformant and serving an oppressive regime. This comparison highlights some of the challenges and negative experiences that neurodivergent individuals may face in society. There is a cluster of statistics suggesting that NDs have a higher likelihood of using marijuana or psilocybin for medication, a higher representation in the drug-related and ND prison population, increased vulnerability to bad interactions with law enforcement even for law-abiding NDs, a higher risk of being targeted by criminals, and a higher probability of NTs blindly supporting these aspects due to just-world phenomenon and victim-blaming cognitive biases.

- Vulcans (from Star Trek) vs. Klingons/Ferengi/Borgs:
  * Fictional counterpart: Vulcans are depicted as beings with high intelligence and logic, who prioritize control of their emotions. In comparison, NTs may exhibit characteristics similar to Klingons in terms of confrontational behavior, and self-serving and greedy behavior like Ferengi. Additionally, NTs can be likened to Borgs in their assimilation of technology and their desire to assimilate neurodivergent individuals into their hyper-conformist society.
  * Real-life counterpart: NDs often possess high levels of empathy and logical thinking abilities, but they may also experience challenges with emotional regulation, alexithymia (difficulty identifying and describing emotions), and interoception (awareness of bodily sensations).

- Divergents (from the movie) vs. Conformists:
  * Fictional counterpart: Divergents are individuals who deviate from societal norms and exhibit multiple traits or talents.
  * Real-life counterpart: Neurodivergent individuals, including NDs, possess a range of unique characteristics and abilities, which may deviate from societal expectations.

- L2 humans vs. L0/L1 humans (from Aeon14):
  * Fictional counterpart: L2 humans have higher node density, faster processing speeds, and enhanced reflexes.
  * Real-life counterpart: NDs often exhibit increased neuronal branching and connectivity, but they may have slower processing speeds. This can lead to strengths in verbal comprehension but may also be associated with conditions like dyspraxia.

- Witches/Wizards/Shamans/Monks vs. Cowans/Muggles/Squibs:
  * Fictional counterpart: Witches, wizards, shamans, and monks have supernatural abilities associated with magical or mystical practices.
  * Real-life counterpart: Neurodivergent individuals, including NDs, often possess a hyperfocus on their special interests, allowing them to acquire in-depth knowledge and skills that may surpass those of NTs without physiological modifications.

- Homo Sapiens Originalis vs. Homo Sapiens Domesticus/Infernus:
  * Fictional counterpart: The concepts of Homo Sapiens Originalis and Homo Sapiens Domesticus/Infernus are derived from Lakota myths and describe the fall of a high civilization and the subsequent rebuilding using a hybrid humanoid species.
  * Real-life counterpart: Although we have evidence of multiple hominin species in our ancestral lineage, including Homo neanderthalensis, Homo denisova, and Homo erectus, the specific concepts described in the myths do not have direct real-life counterparts.

- Adam vs. Eve (from the Bible):
  * Fictional counterpart: Adam has been proposed to mean the original mankind, both male and female; whereas Eve is a duplicate mankind able to hybridize with the original.
  * Real-life counterpart: The existence and historical identities of Adam and Eve, as described in the Bible, lack concrete evidence and are subject to individual beliefs and interpretations.

- Auties/outies vs. boxies:
  * NTs (Neurotypical individuals) are sometimes referred to as "boxies" because they are perceived to think inside the box, adhering to conventional norms and expectations.
  * Neurodivergent individuals, such as autistics (often referred to as "Auties" or "outies"), tend to think outside the box and deviate from conventional norms and expectations.

- Acoustics vs. Dissonants:
  * NDs (Neurodivergent individuals) are generally known to have strengths in music and may have a natural ability to live in harmony with nature and other species.
  * NTs (Neurotypical individuals), on the other hand, may not have the same affinity for music or living in harmony and may experience a sense of discordance within themselves and in their relationships with others.

- Outliers vs. Marginalizers:
  * NDs (Neurodivergent individuals), being a minority, are often marginalized due to their differences. However, they can also be outliers, exhibiting exceptional performance or abilities in certain areas.
  * NTs (Neurotypical individuals), being the majority, may not always effectively address the needs of marginalized populations. This can result in corner or edge cases, such as neurodivergent individuals, being overlooked or not properly supported, allowing them to "slip through the cracks," so to speak.
