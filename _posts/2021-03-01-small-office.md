Just because system administration and other tech stuff can be complicated,
it doesn't mean that you have to forgo these niceties.

1. Create a corporate e-mail address, and authorize your sys admin.
   We use gmx, because:
   - it's not google.
   - it supports imap/pop3
     (for non-technical readers, this allows e-mail voodoo, such as routing it through your corporate servers, allowing for you to control and execute complex logic).
   - it's encrypted (which is only as good as your imap/pop3 setup), and can be used for pseudo-anonymity (in theory, at least).
2. Create a google account using your corporate e-mail address.
   N.b., you don't need to create a gmail account--just a google account,
   which will be used for other google services, such as:
   - google voice
   - google business
   - youtube
3. Connect your google voice number to various VOIP services to simplify international calling:
   - WhatsApp
   - Skype
   - Signal
   - Telegram
4. Authorize your sys admin to access relevant accounts such as google business and youtube.
5. Pick your top three platforms, create business pages, and fill out the profiles. E.g.,
   - Facebook
   - LinkedIn
   - Twitter or InstaGram
6. Create an account on buffer, link it to your top social media pages, and authorize your sys admin.
   Use buffer to post to your top three platforms, rather than posting directly.
7. Specific types of content:
   - Video... your sys admin will help you mirror your video content on facebook, youtube and other platforms.
   - Audio... if you have audio content, your sys admin will help you mirror it to soundcloud and other platforms.
   - Literature... if you have literature, such as blog posts, e-books, etc., your sys admin will help you mirror it to tumblr and other platforms
   - Photos... TODO... snapchat, instagram, etc.
8. Setup a payment system, such as:
   - PayPal
   - Square
   - Stripe
   - SumUp
   - others, according to your country of business
9. If your team is large enough, you'll want a slack workspace to centralize communications and collaboration.
   Your sys admin can help you bridge your slack workspace to other platforms,
   but you will have to host the bridge bot yourself or on a VPS.
   Hosting your own corporate servers is another topic, as you will probably need to host sundry other services.
