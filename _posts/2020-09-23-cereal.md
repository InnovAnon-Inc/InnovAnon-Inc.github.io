More butter can be emulsified into hot cereals, such as oatmeal,
cream of wheat or grits,
by appropriating an Indian technique:
- roast grains in one pan while boiling salted, syrupy mixture in other pan
- combine, return to boil
- possibly add more grains to thicken
- simmer
- remove from heat, add any additional sweeteners, fats or creams
