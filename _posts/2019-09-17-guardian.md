NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



The Guardian Vow is an out-dated and mostly-obselete addition to the core practices.

These Adepts undertake an indefinite daily sadhana to enhance their Siddhis related to:
- Offensive/Defensive Martial Chi abilities
- Necromancy, including healing and resurrections

They are taught an additional number of specific techniques,
usually involving talismens, poppets and other props.

They vow to cease to exist before failing their specific task,
usually protecting another living thing.

In addition to these things,
the members of the organization react differently to these so-called, "Guardians."
Guardians are considered living martyrs, and therefore already dead.
Members of the organization will step aside when a Guardian is passing,
and leave the room or building when a Guardian is entering.
This acts to stratify the Guardian class from others,
encapsulating their sub-cultures.
Furthermore, it gets people out of the way,
so the Guardians can work.
