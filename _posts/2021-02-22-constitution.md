TODO
- social engineering:
  various non-human species should be taught to use or rely on human-made technologies.
  this will require manipulating critical masses in various populations in a region.
  examples:
  - species may be taught to prefer cooked food,
    and to therefore bring uncooked food or other resources to a designated area,
    in order to exchange it for cooked food.
  - species may be taught to recognize an authorized tribe,
    allowing only that tribe in the secure region (i.e., the nature reserve).
    those species could enforce a zero-tolerance policy
    where unauthorized humans will be neutralized.
  - species may be taught to alert other species
    in the event that unauthorized humans access the secure region.
- list of possible species and example integrations:
  - primates
    - food, enforcement
  - ravens, crows, falcons, hawks, etc.
    - food, enforcement
  - wolves, dogs, etc.
    - food, enforcement, alerting
  - cobras
    - food, enforcement
  - peacocks and possibly other species
    - alerting
  - big cats
    - food
  - whales, dolphins
    - food, enforcement
- a constitution should be drafted to grant citizenship,
  including rights and protections,
  to the various species included in the trade federation.
  the trade federation should operate with the goal of maximizing
  resources and intrinsic quality of life for all its citizens.
- various species could possibly fill roles in a large-scale free-range ranching operation
  that ensures large, healthy populations of game for the carnivorous species in the federation.
- other species could possibly fill roles in a large-scale permaculture operation
  that ensures sufficient acreage of fruits and vegetables for herbivorous species in the federation.
