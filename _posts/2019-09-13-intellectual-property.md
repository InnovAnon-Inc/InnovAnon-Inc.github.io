NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



Hardwares, softwares and other technologies such as those used by the wetworks units
pose a massive anonymity-compromising risk to your organization's back-end units.

An exotic or otherwise bleeding-edge technology can appear on another organization's radar for a couple reasons:
  - that technology's first use in that region
  - a spike in that technology's use in that region

You can begin to mitigate this risk by separating your departments:
  - The R&D and engineering departments develop some technology,
    and also design variants of the technology's implementation.
    These units should be well-isolated from the technician-units.
    These units can feasibly be close or even members of the inner circle.
  - Separate units actually build the technology based on the variants of the design.
    The designs are dead dropped for them;
    the materials are anonymously sourced and dead dropped for them.
    The inner circle must be encapsulated from these units, although they are protected and long-lived.
  - Separate units use the technology.
    The devices are dead dropped for them.
    The device-building units and the inner circle must be encapsulated from the units.
    Ideally, they should dead drop the technologies once they have completed their assignment,
    so that those technologies can be disposed of, repurposed or liquidated as appropriate.
