We'll be dealing with this section of the PC tier system:
- Apprentice: Fourth Level Initiates;   training under one or more Adept(s)
- Adept:      Fifth  Level Initiates;   fully-fledged priests
- Arch-Adept: Sixth  Level Initiate(s); fully-fledged papal authorities

The Arch-Adept can be self-proclaimed, appointed, elected, etc.
Adepts automatically become Arch-Adepts when leaving their organization and becoming solitary.
A faction gets its reputation from that of its Adepts, especially its Arch-Adepts.
Having a history of respected Arch-Adepts is certainly helpful.

There are strict rules for each level of initiation.
It is absolutely necessary to maintain the rigor of these tests.
This is to help maintain a minimum baseline reputation for each faction.

Generally, Adepts will refuse to demonstrate any sort of supernatural ability,
except to their Apprentice(s) and occassionally other Adepts.
This is to help prevent the laymen from putting the Adepts on the spot.

The Trial of Fifth Level Initiation:
- a quorum of Fifth Level Initiates (or higher) should witness the phenomenon
- the Fourth Level Initiate should demonstrate the expected level of competency in some Siddhi

Over time, we have developed and adapted these requirements.
As such, even some of our past's more accomplished Adepts might not pass the contemporary Trial of Fifth Level Initiation,
for, in previous generations, less flashy schools of practice were allowed more prominence.

The recent trend to favor vulgar manipulations of the material world
is intended to produce a generation of Adepts that will impress the ignorant masses:
even a non-believing atheist will begin recognize obvious real-world results,
even if he/she isn't yet ready to shift his/her worldview.
