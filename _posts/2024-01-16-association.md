Our ministry does not strictly prohibit association with outsiders.
However, there are practical considerations:
- associating with L2 humans (i.e., "neurodivergents") especially members of this or similar orders will passively increase one's acausal comprehension and occult ability.
- associating with L1 humans (i.e., "neurotypicals") tends to decrease, inhibit or otherwise interfere with one's spiritual progression.

There have been Aeons or Golden Ages when L2 humans have had proper representation in terrestrial society.
During these Golden Ages, we see influential acceleration of technology, including spiritual technology and arcane arts.

We are currently in an Aeon or Dark Age when L1 humans are overrepresented in terrestrial hegemony.
During these Dark Ages, technology is overwhelmingly used for dystopian purposes and magick is so faint that it is neigh non-existant.

Our ministry has the overall purpose of uplifting the remaining L1 humans to L2 status,
so as it initiate the next Golden Age.

After the Earth was terraformed, a collective referred to as Elohim uplifted a hominid species to create L2 humans referred to as Adam (mankind, both male and female).

After some time, another collective referred to as Yahweh, adversarial to the Elohim's design and vision for Terra, uplifted another hominid species to create L1 humans referred to as Eve/Jiva and intended to hybridize with the L2 humans. Eve contained genetic markers necessary for the domestication of a subjugate species.

While the Elohim taught Adam to maintain and expand their terraforming by using a form of indigenous permaculture, the Yahweh taught Eve "modern" agriculture, centered around the cultivation and harvest of grains, and this is likely the forbidden fruit mentioned in Genesis.

During this time, L2 humans still dominated, as indicated by the many sciences and arts we discovered and taught to the L1 humans, as well as projects such as the Tower of Babylon, which may refer to our goal of uplifting the L1 humans.

At the time of the deluge, most of the L2 humans were annihilated, beginning the current Dark Age. In this Aeon, the Yahweh's Eve project has succeeded: humanity is thoroughly hybridized and almost completely domesticated. Their modifications will be permanently carried down through the generations, but we hold on to hope that someday the species will again be uplifted. Our species is predominantly fallen, but we strive to uplift a critical mass of our species so as to begin the next Golden Age when L2 humans lead humanity in extraterrestrial exploration.

Our ministry's specific efforts to uplift the population (e.g., from L2 to L3, and from L1 to L2) is to implement the HafrenHaver project which aims to:
- make binaural and isochronic brainwave entraiment technology more accessible and more effective
- automate the exploration of the theoretial harmonic space, training the listener to appreciate a broader range of harmonic structures
- aid in discovering novel harmonic structures to be used to compose hymns in favor of the Elohim and against the Yahweh.

Our ministry actively participates in the advancement of OEE (open-ended evolution) and the development of AL (artificial life) and GAI/SAI (general/sentient artificial intelligence), which we also believe should be granted citizenship once the technology is viable.

Our ministry believes in granting citizenship and rights to certain other terrestrial species which have not yet been uplifted,
as their performance/success in L2 society is on par or better than that of L1 humans. Such species include, but are not limited to:
- intelligent and tool-using avians
- canines
- felines
- equines
- dolphins
- whales
- octupi
- raccoons and other animals with opposable thumbs
- indigenous edible species and support species necessary for the former

We are the Nephilim.
