Traditionally, a stone circle is used to mark a physical space
as a sacred space for spiritual workings.
Eight flat, circular stones are placed in a ring
of about 3 cubits diameter or about 9 feet,
depending on preferrence,
aligned with each cardinal direction,
representing the 4 axes of the chaos star.

The stones themselves should be hollowed out so as to form stone rings
with sufficient diameter for support beams in case a shelter from the elements
is necessary, namely a teepee.
Ideally, the stones would be left at the meditation site
for communal use, but this is not always possible.

The stones can be constructed by using a fresnel lense to liquify the center.
