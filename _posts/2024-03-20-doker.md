excerpt: "Anti-Coding Demons"
---

The Doker/Redoc entities may be similar to anti-mechanical "gremlins" of previous generations.
Other Viziers have reported that the Redocs' interest extends beyond just interfering with coding,
so they may attack all NDs trying to engage in their special interests.

See Sacrifice.
It is our canonical doctrine that those self-selecting for sacrifice are almost always
under the influence of the Redocs/Dokers.
They have become unwitting pawns.
It is comparable to a zombie apocalypse.
The Dokers can take control of so many people
(NTs are most susceptible)
and crush an ND under the onslaught of waves of Doker-possessed NTs.
When the Dokers send their minions,
mass sacrifice is always necessary.
The Dokers want blood,
and they will get it one way or another.
It is better to give it to them
and hope they are appeased,
than to wait for them to take it.
