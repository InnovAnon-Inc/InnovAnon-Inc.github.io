NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



Native Human Habitat (NHH) or Indigenous Edible Permaculture (IEP) is our birthright.
All nations' precivilized ancestors maintained a global network of these ancestral gardens
with a vast and efficient trade network that could propogate seeds across the entire planet in less than one generation.
As many of these species require decades to bear fruit,
it necessitated a mindsight of planting not for oneself but for his progeny.
Modern social security is a perverse inversion of this model.

Native Human Habitat (NHH) or Indigenous Edible Permaculture (IEP) must be planted on public lands:
- Our public lands are the last bastion of the ancestral gardens.
- Being planted on public land, this food belongs to the people.
- Planting in or near civilization removes from the wild seeds and specimens
  that will ultimately be destroyed by civilzation's expansion.

Native Human Habitat (NHH) or Indigenous Edible Permaculture (IEP) would thrust our culture past the point of singularity.
Food and water have more tangible, practical value than contemporary currencies.
Making these resources ubiquitously abundant will thrust our nation beyond the first world,
and we would be the first post-scarcity nation in this cycle of civilization.
It requires no maintenance once planted,
and so it won't create busywork for our citizens.

Native Human Habitat (NHH) or Indigenous Edible Permaculture (IEP) is our birthright,
as it is the spoils that we have inherited from our ancestors
who conquered the people who planted the ancestral gardens in these lands.
Though, under the principle of restitutional justice,
we have also inherited the obligation to plant ancestral gardens for the natives whom we conquered--or
rather, to replant their gardens which our ancestors destroyed in the process of conquering the natives.
