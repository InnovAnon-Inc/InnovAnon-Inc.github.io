If an individual can attain a high-enough level of spiritual development,
then he can begin reincarnating, rather than being reabsorbed into the Super Soul.

The process of repeated reincarnation is an alchemical one;
it purges the mind so that the soul can be fully manifest in the body
(i.e., so that your acausal nature can fully utilize your causal nature).

When reincarnating, our minds pass through the Filter,
which wipes them of many of their attributes, characteristics, memories, etc.

As the mind is purified and the nexion is empowered,
the Filter has diminishing effectiveness on the mind.

Once the mind is fully purified and the acausal nature is fully manifest in the causal nature,
Ashta Siddhi is attained.
A state of Turiya is maintained at this level.
This is the Seventh Level Initiation.
