We'll be dealing with this section of the PC tier system:
- Lesser Gods: Seventh  Level Initiate(s); fully-fledged Acausal consciousnesses

The Trial of Seventh Level Initiation:
- a quorum of Fifth Level Initiates (or higher) should witness the phenomenon
- For Causal entities:
  - the Fifth or Sixth Level Initiate should demonstrate the expected level of competency in the Ashta Siddhi
- For Acausal entities:
  - merely appearing in the Causal plane should suffice
