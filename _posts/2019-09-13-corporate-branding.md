NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



Our brand:
- InnovAnon
- Innovations Anonymous
- Free Code for a Free World!

Graphics that should induce nostalgia re: our brand:
- The little dancing shiva,
- the Kali Yantra's red eye glowing as if to say, "I'm sorry, Dave."
- Public domain (or permissively-licensed) artwork and technology through and through.

General culture and quirks:
- Code-monks, Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism), Sanatan Dharma (eternal lifeway)
- A culture that is a "cross between Curious George and the Spanish Inquisition."
- The coven that leads a congregation.

Controversial buzzwords, etc.:
- Post-scarcity, post-civilization, post-human.
- Human programming technology and spiritual technology.
- Literal and figurative sorcery.

Things to consider:
- Website:
  your organization needs a URL.
  Some content served from that URL would be great, too.
  InnovAnon, Inc., for example, uses free static hosting at: InnovAnon-Inc.github.io,
  with plans to use as a back-end for dynamic content lmaddox.chickenkiller.com,
  which is setup with DDNS.
- SEO:
  your organization needs to dominate the first page of results on major search engines.
- Technical documentation, including JavaDocs:
  your corporate branding, including your logo, should appear here.
- Boot loader background images:
  give your employees a healthy dose of your cult's flavor of offbrand fruit punch as soon as possible in your computer's boot sequence.
- Boot loader startup sound:
  an additional touch which, if using your corporate jingle, can add a powerful auditory component to the delivery of your cult's fruit punch.
- /etc/issue, /etc/issue.net, the MoTD, QoTD, fortunes, etc.:
  accessing one of our systems? here's some Kool-aid.
- Desktop background images:
  ensure that your employees consume an extra dose of Kool-aid when they minimize all windows.
- Screen saver images and text:
  if you can read this, then break-time's over. Also, here's a double shot of Kool-aid.
- Social media:
  InnovAnon, Inc., for example, is on 20+ social media platforms.
- Other servers:
  InnovAnon, Inc., for example, hosts game servers, etc., which can appear on a list on master servers.
  Scrolling through the list of available servers in your region on, e.g., DoomSeeker, Armagetronad, etc.?
  Lo! there's InnovAnon: have some Kool-aid.
- Community Outreach:
  Never miss an opportunity mention your organization when you're out and about in your daily life.
  InnovAnon, Inc., for example, encourages priests to carry a stash of extra resources, such as loose change,
  so as to be able to help, e.g., beggars,
  which opens an opportunity to distribute native seeds and to preach the gospel:
  that he has now increased a level or two from Level 0
  and has now become an active participant in the spiritual and cultural war.
