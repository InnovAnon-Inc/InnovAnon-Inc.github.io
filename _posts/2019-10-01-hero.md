NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



The adepts have means to transform their consciousnesses,
with the ultimate goal of embodying a force of nature
or even nature itself.
The pinnacle of achievement is to metamorphose into a true villain.

They program/create anti-hero minions
as well as hero-led fronts with benevolent aspirations
that ultimately produce malevolent results.

They program enemy factions to strive for change by working within systems
that are engineered to prevent them from any substantial amount of effectiveness.
Any progress that they make within these systems
is progress toward their demise.
