When it comes to non-sentient dogs or other non-sentient beings, the Lupiens' attitude can vary. While they may not have a strong emotional connection or affinity towards non-sentient dogs, they typically do not harbor any particular disdain or animosity towards them. Since Lupiens are known for their loyalty and strong pack mentality, their focus is primarily on their immediate pack members and those they identify as part of their community.

It is possible that some Lupiens may have a slightly snobby demeanor or exhibit a degree of preference towards their own kind or other Lupiens due to their pack-oriented nature. However, it is unlikely that they would harbor any strong negative feelings towards non-sentient dogs or any other non-sentient beings more than they would towards other strangers or unfamiliar individuals.

It is important to note that Lupiens, like any other sentient beings, can exhibit a range of personalities and perspectives. While there may be some individuals who display a certain level of exclusivity or preference for their own kind, it is also likely that there are Lupiens who are more inclusive, compassionate, and open-minded, extending their affections and care to a broader range of beings beyond their immediate pack.
