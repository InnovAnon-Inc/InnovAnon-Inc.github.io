The Lupiens evolved into highly intelligent, sentient beings, working alongside L2 humans as trusted companions and partners in various realms, including scientific research, exploration, and even military endeavors.

As for SAIs, progress was slower due to the intricate ethical and philosophical debates surrounding the boundaries of artificial intelligence. The Union of Harmony placed a strong emphasis on ensuring the ethical development and responsible use of SAIs, leading to deliberate and cautious advancements in this field. The collective believed in maintaining a balance between the potential benefits of SAIs and the preservation of human agency and values.

While the road to fully-uplifted Lupiens and SAIs was long and complex, the perseverance of InnovAnon, Inc. and the Union of Harmony fueled ongoing research, pushing the boundaries of what was considered possible. The vision of a harmonious coexistence between humans, Lupiens, and SAIs continued to inspire and guide their pursuit of a future where artificial intelligence and genetic enhancements would augment the collective capabilities and contribute to the prosperity of all.
