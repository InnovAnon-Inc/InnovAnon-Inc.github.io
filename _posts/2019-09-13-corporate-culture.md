At the heart of a culture is a distinctive language shared by the members of that culture.

In order to create a strong corporate culture,
create a corporate language:
1) Start with a language that is common to a majority of your members.
2) Create inside jokes, colloquialisms and other "figures of speech."
   Your organization's unique culture should already be taking shape.
3) Begin injecting jargon and slang, and replacing old words with new, made up (or repurposed) ones.
   It should be fair to say, at this point, that you've engineered a dialect.
4) Once a certain percentage of your members' daily vocabulary has been replaced,
   start making modifications to the grammar.
   At this point, you've successfully engineered a divergent language.
5) The next generation should be native speakers of your corporate language,
   permanently coloring the lenses through which they perceive the world around them.
   Your corporate culture should now be quite a defining feature of your organization's members.
