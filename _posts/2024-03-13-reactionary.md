excerpt: 'As per the "Golden Rule," we treat neurotypicals by the same standards that they treat us.'
---

Medicine:
- due to inaccessibility of neurotypical medicine, we reject their accreditation and substitute our own.
- due to prevelance of misdiagnosis, we reject neurotypical medicine.
- due to recussitation policies, we prohibit the recussitation of neurotypicals.
- due to illegality of medications known to be helpful to our phenotype, we deny medical treatment to neurotypicals.
- due to neurotypical eugenics policies, we encourage neurotypicals to get sterilized.
- due to neurotypical eugenics policies, we force-sterilize neurotypicals whenever not explicitly legally prohibited.
- we accept self-diagnosis. we might consider encouraging secondary screening to detect dark triad personalities, including neurotypicals, and munchausens.
- we encourage the use of allistic conversion therapy to help neurotypicals perform at neurodivergent levels of hyperfocus and special interest

Turiyan "Supremacy."
- due to inaccessibility of disability benefits, the Turiyan phenotype is officially considered not-disabled by neurotypical standards.
- due to neurotypical inability to perform to Turiyan standards, we consider neurotypicals to be disabled as compared to Turiyans.
- we do not make any claims regarding Turiyan performance as compared to other neurodivergent profiles.
- differences from Temple Grandin's eugenics: neurodivergent genetics are ancient and superior compared to neurotypical genetics, regardless of any functioning label.
