How contemporary cults perpetrate human sacrifice:
Human Programming Technology (HPT)

Carrying out at least one human sacrifice is a commonly accepted step,
considered to be necessary, to attaining Acausal consciousness.

With aeonically-minded organizations,
the goal is to maximize the organization's "score,"
and to minimize all non-allied faction's "scores."

Therefore, contemporary human sacrifice focuses not on sacrificing one individual
but instead on programming that individual to "sacrifice" others on a mass scale.

It is important to note that contemporary sacrifice does not necessarily kill the person immediately.
Imprisoning someone or otherwise preventing him from manifesting his creative energies
is just as effective--even more so--than outright killing him ritualistically.



The universe is a machine;
humans are machines:
we respond to certain stimuli with certain thoughts, feelings and actions.
This is the principle by which Human Programming Technology can exist.
The less self-aware a person is, the more susceptible to HPT he is,
though all are susceptible at least to some degree.



An effective organization will identify individuals who are at risk for suicide,
and leverage them for sacrifices,
rather than allowing its human resources to waste themselves.



Contemporary human sacrifice is subtle,
contrasting with traditional sacrifices
that outright eviscerated people upon altars:
the one who is to be sacrificed
is groomed and conditioned over some amount of time,
even his whole life.

Most are blind to the subtle techniques being used,
but knowing how to perform a contemporary sacrifice
will open your eyes to how prevalent the practice is in our society.

The increase of mass shooters is only the tip of the iceberg:
consider the amount of people who are broken by their upbringing and other life circumstances
and who end up locked in prison.



Since we are well aware of the science behind this Human Programming Technology,
we can foresee who is becoming a sacrifice.

Knowing somethings way--its pattern--we have the power to interfere
either to help or to harm.

This is the essence of the hunter-gathering lifestyle:
knowing what a deer does, where it will be, etc.,
we choose to help it by leaving corn and other food
where that deer will be,
and ultimately we choose to harm it by harvesting and eating it.

Seeing that someone is being groomed for sacrifice,
we become that person's hunter,
choosing to help him by stopping the inputs that will condition him for sacrifice
or choosing to harm him by not interfering or even exacerbating those conditions.



Human sacrifices are not a relic of the past;
they're not an isolated incident.
Human sacrifices are more prevalent today than ever before:
they occur every single day in every single country.



Sieze your opportunity:
perform a sacrifice--begin grooming the sacrifice today.

It's quite easy,
and it's a stepping stone on the path to Acausal consciousness.

Remember that the easiest demographic to radicalize and to groom for sacrifice is
the forgotten, left-behind, down-trodden and disenfranchised.

Remembering this will allow you to sleep easily at night,
for you've merely taken society's sacrifice and turned it into your own sacrifice,
harnessing the resulting spiritual energies to develop your own Acausal consciousness,
rather than allowing those energies to go to waste unharvested.
