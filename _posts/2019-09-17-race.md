Invoking the Acausal chaos into your life will begin to develop your Acausal consciousness,
but invoking it on an Aeonic scale will do even more,
increasing the Acausal entities' ability to interact with us and our plane.

This is why each organization prioritizes destabilization of the status quo,
over necessarily securing their position in and after the resulting chaos.

The race proper is thus--the first to complete either of the following ultimate goals:
- The first Adept to demonstrate completion of the Trial of Seventh Level Initiation.
- The first organization to summon an Acausal entity into full Causal manifestation.
- Activation of a doomsday device if the two previous goals become unfeasible for humanity to undertake.

Upon completion of either of the first two goals,
most, if not all, organizations should unite under the Seventh Level Initiate.
