excerpt: "Experiment to Determine Result of Increased Evolutionary Pressure"

To determine this, it will be necessary to establish environments of two types:
- one that favors neurotypical   performance (i.e., the control)
- one that favors neurodivergent performance

It seems like you have a hypothesis that Population B may produce more adaptable and useful specimens compared to Population A because agents in Population B have selective pressure to perform well in Simulation A while still performing well in Simulation B.

To test this hypothesis, you could perform the following steps:

- Define measures of adaptability and usefulness for the agents in your populations. These measures could include performance metrics in both Simulation A and Simulation B.

- Select a sample of agents from Population A and Population B.

- Evaluate the adaptability and usefulness of the agents from both populations based on the defined measures. Compare the performance of the agents from Population A in both Simulation A and Simulation B. Similarly, evaluate the performance of the agents from Population B in both simulations.

- Analyze and compare the results to determine if there are significant differences in adaptability and usefulness between the populations. You can use statistical tests such as t-tests or ANOVA to test for significance.

- Repeat the process multiple times with different samples to validate the results and ensure consistency.

By following these steps, you can assess whether Population B produces more adaptable and useful specimens compared to Population A based on their performance in both Simulation A and Simulation B.
