NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



Although an organization might support a post-scarcity society--an intentional civilization,
there are nuances to understand:
  - something such as universal basic income may allow for a golden age of recruitment and technological development for us.
  - we suspect that mainstream society will suffer from the Rat Utopia effect,
    hopefully ultimately leading to a collapse of civilization as we know it.
  - this should drastically increase the recruitment pool for intentional civilization.
  - in order to be considered for membership in the intentional civilization,
    a candidate should be born and raised in the wilderness.
    We want a return to our ancestral ways--a return to our niche as a species in an ecosystem.
  - furthermore, in order to be considered for membershp in the intentional civilization,
    a candidate should pass an examination of potential for mathematical and technical competency,
    and accept his or her placement in a job role, such as technician, engineer or researcher.
  - the intentional civilization will offer no form of retirement, social security or welfare.

It should be made clear that the primary objective
is to bring about (i.e., accelerate) the collapse of the current iteration of civilization.

The secondary objective is to implement an intentional civilization.
It is of utmost importance that the carrying out of the secondary objective
does not impede or interfere with the carrying out of the first objective.

If the primary objective is not accomplished in a timely manner,
then it is probable that a global mass extinction will annihilate our species.
This is non-ideal, but it does technically accomplish the primary objective.
