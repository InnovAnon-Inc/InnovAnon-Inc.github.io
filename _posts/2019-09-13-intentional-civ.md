Although an organization might support a post-scarcity society--an intentional civilization,
there are nuances to understand:
  - something such as universal basic income may allow for a golden age of recruitment and technological development for us.
  - we suspect that mainstream society will suffer from the Rat Utopia effect,
    hopefully ultimately leading to a collapse of civilization as we know it.
  - this should drastically increase the recruitment pool for intentional civilization.
  - in order to be considered for membership in the intentional civilization,
    a candidate should be born and raised in the wilderness.
    We want a return to our ancestral ways--a return to our niche as a species in an ecosystem.
  - furthermore, in order to be considered for membershp in the intentional civilization,
    a candidate should pass an examination of potential for mathematical and technical competency,
    and accept his or her placement in a job role, such as technician, engineer or researcher.
  - the intentional civilization will offer no form of retirement, social security or welfare.
