The FashionTech Boutique is an innovative concept that combines technology and fashion to create functional and stylish designs. The boutique focuses on patterns that flatter different silhouettes, prints that enhance various complexions, and high-quality natural materials that offer superior temperature regulation and moisture-wicking properties.

In addition to the clothing boutique, the shop features a steel shop section offering superior steel products such as properly-designed beer mugs and spoons, catering to the needs of both households and small restaurants. The goal is to provide economical choices without compromising on quality.

The third-floor tea room and kitchen area serve as a unique space to showcase products. Customers can watch their food being prepared using the shop's superior equipment, while the chef(s) share their personal experiences with the products. This creates an immersive experience and reinforces the quality and functionality of the offerings.

The tea room, furnished with elegant tablecloths, placemats, and other items available for sale, provides a relaxing atmosphere for customers to enjoy tea. It also serves as a platform to demo scented candles or incense created by the shop's herbalist, adding a sensory element to the experience.

To add exclusivity, the FashionTech Boutique offers an onsite steel engraver, allowing customers to commission distinctive patterns on the steelware used in the shop. This customization service comes at an exorbitant rate, giving customers the opportunity to own truly unique pieces.

The FashionTech Boutique aims to become the go-to destination for customers' daily needs, whether they are at home, work, the gym, or attending functions or events. The goal is to create a strong brand loyalty where customers proudly proclaim that nothing less than FashionTech goes into or onto their bodies.

## Proposed Discount Policy:

At FashionTech Boutique, we understand the importance of providing cost-effective solutions for businesses while maintaining the highest quality standards. With that in mind, we propose the following discount policy for shop owners and their employees:

- Negotiated Deals for Shop Owners: When a shop owner approaches us with their uniform needs, we will engage in negotiations to determine a mutually beneficial arrangement. This will be based on the potential cost savings for the shop owner, taking into account factors such as the number of uniforms needed and the frequency of purchases. We will work closely with the shop owner to create a tailored solution that meets their requirements.

- Per-Company Discount for Employees: As part of our commitment to supporting businesses and their employees, we will offer a per-company discount for employees of our client companies. This means that employees from the same company can purchase their uniforms from FashionTech Boutique at a discounted rate. This discount will be based on the negotiated deal between FashionTech Boutique and the shop owner, ensuring that employees have access to high-quality uniforms at a reduced cost.

- Matching Color and Basic Style: We believe that uniforms should maintain a consistent and professional appearance. Thus, our focus will be on providing uniforms in matching colors and basic styles that align with the branding and image of the company. This ensures a cohesive and unified look across the workforce.

- Flattering Patterns for Individual Silhouettes: In addition to matching colors and basic styles, we recognize the importance of individuality and personal comfort. Therefore, we will offer a range of patterns that are specifically designed to flatter different body shapes and silhouettes. By utilizing spools of the same material, we can create multiple uniforms optimized for various body shapes, ensuring that employees feel confident and comfortable in their attire.

By implementing this discount policy, we aim to foster strong relationships with shop owners and their employees, providing them with high-quality uniforms that are both cost-effective and tailored to their specific needs.
