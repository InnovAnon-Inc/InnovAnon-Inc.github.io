You're doing it wrong.

It's fine to not have the desire to pursue higher things,
per se. Admittedly, the desire to do so is considered an
extraordinary ability--your first supernatural ability,
called vairyaga siddhi.

So, say alchemy is not for you.
Instead, fulfilling your base desires
is all you want to do.
Well, even then, you are going about it
in the wrong way and you don't even have
a frame of reference for any other way.

You have to learn to walk before you can run,
and so you will attain the vairyaga siddhi
in a subsequent life, after you learn how to
properly be an animal.

When a bird eats berries,
it does so because it is tasty.
The bird takes to the sky,
and shits as it pleases,
with no reason for concern about where it lands.
And yet, seeds are dropped,
and species are propagated.

Eating and shitting,
being eaten and being shat,
simply by doing the things they do,
beauty is created.

This is called Wu Wei, or doing by not-doing,
or doing without effort.

These species don't have the same intellectual capacity
as we do, yet we do have something in common:
consciousness.
There's some state of pure awareness underlying our
consciousness, and indeed the all minds.

Accessing this state of pure awareness
is called flow or grace.

Observe the fruits of your actions
without resting on your accomplishments
or dwelling on your failures.
Just observe, learn and reconcile if possible.

If your actions are right,
then the result will be beauty;
if your actions are wrong,
then the result will be foul.

The common way of eating
ultimately leaves the land barren,
draining more water from the tables
than can be replenished.

The common way of shitting
is equally unpleasant,
though certainly more salient.

There is another way:
I have seen a human walk a path of grace.

I have seen the effects of a mere human
who had only Wu Wei, and not even the
vairyaga siddhi.

When picking food from the gardens,
she'd plant more seeds:
by taking she was giving,
and the gardens grew thicker with food.

When leaving camp, all the weeds would
be dead and the soil would be ready for
planting, fertilized by the campfire.

She'd drop some seeds, saying that something
will grow there and, knowing this, we could
decide what would grow there.

She'd leave a garden in her wake.

She told me a better way for handling
one's leavings: jf you do nothing else
in this life, take a trip to the countryside
and eat some berries.

Don't cook the berries.
Don't make jam or any pie.
Instead, eat the berries
with the living seeds.

Go high up on a hilltop that has gravel.
This is the optimal place for your droppings.
Do the deed and cover it with aforementioned
gravel.

The bush will sprout, and the berries
will drop.

"Shit rolls downhill," and so your
shit-berries will someday cover the
entire hillside.

It's all in a day's work.

Archeologists discovered the remains
of a tribe of women who wrapped up
their poo like little tamales.

Why would anyone go through such lengths?

Well, you see... you save the poo
over the Winter. You keep it in a place
where the dogs won't get to it.
And you visit hilltops in the Spring.

She said the natives spoke of a land
with food as far as the eye can see,
and you couldn't take a step without
stepping on bread-root (the staple).

I said we have a phrase for this,
"the Garden of Eden."

I've taken pilgrimage to the Garden of Eden,
and seen another way, giving me the frame of
reference, despite being born in captivity,
 to see more clearly what we are doing
wrong, and how it can be done right.

I've seen a life-giving, hunter-gathering, symbiotic walk in beauty.
