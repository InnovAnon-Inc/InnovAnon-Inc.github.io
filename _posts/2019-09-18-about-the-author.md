NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



I am the current Arch-Adept (Sixth Level Initiate) of InnovAnon, Inc.'s core faction.
I was granted permission to assume control a couple years before Master Faust was martyred,
and began modifying our practices and bylaws to prepare for expansion.

During my high school and university years, I was a programmer.
After attempting several businesses, each of which had all their assets stolen and/or sabotaged,
I went on haaj (pilgrimage) to the ancestral gardens.

In these gardens, food grew so dense that I could not take a step without crushing several edible specimens,
and the food grew as far as I could see in all directions.
There, I was mentored by an incarnate Class S, Seventh Level Initiate.

I am a veteran of mortal combat and an ex-POW.
I was attacked at gunpoint while sleeping in my bed
and subsequently captured by a militarized terrorist faction
and held prisoner for three days,
until my family paid the ransom.

I was wearing only my kirpan at the time.
Although I never drew my kirpan,
I managed to fend off my attacker with improvised melee weaponry,
and evaded the bullets he fired at me.

The expressely anti-Sikh terrorists confiscated and never returned my kirpan.
Since that time, I have stopped wearing the panj kakkars,
so as to blend in with the dominant culture
and to more effectively a wage war of annihilation against the terrorist faction.

After my service to this nation,
the State has refused to compensate me or my family for our sacrifices,
and so the only way I (and some of our other clergy) can afford food, clothes, a terminal for programming or a place to stay
is by the graciousness of our supporters.
