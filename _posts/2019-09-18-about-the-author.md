NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



I am the current Arch-Adept (Sixth Level Initiate) of InnovAnon, Inc.'s core faction.
I was granted permission to assume control a couple years before Master Faust was martyred,
and began modifying our practices and bylaws to prepare for expansion.

During my high school and university years, I was a programmer.
After attempting several businesses, each of which had all their assets stolen and/or sabotaged,
I went on haaj (pilgrimage) to the ancestral gardens.

In these gardens, food grew so dense that I could not take a step without crushing several edible specimens,
and the food grew as far as I could see in all directions.
There, I was mentored by an incarnate Class S, Seventh Level Initiate.

I am a veteran of mortal combat and an ex-POW.
I was attacked at gunpoint while sleeping on my cot
and subsequently captured by a militarized terrorist faction
and held prisoner for three days,
until my family paid the ransom.

Let us take a moment to explicitly define the precise meanings of the terms I am using:
- Veteran:         "A combat veteran is a person who has fought in combat during... a skirmish against a declared enemy."
- Skirmish:        "An episode of irregular or unpremeditated fighting, especially between small or outlying parts of armies or fleets."
- Combat:          "Fighting between armed forces."
- Armed Forces:    "A country's military forces."
- Military Forces: "If they become engaged in hostilities it will trigger the intervention of stronger military forces."

I was wearing only my kirpan at the time.
(To be honest, I was stark naked,
not even wearing my kachhera, kangha or patka).
Although I never drew my kirpan,
I managed to fend off my attacker with improvised melee weaponry,
and evaded the bullets he fired at me.
Let the record show that I took a knife to this gunfight.

The expressely anti-Sikh terrorists confiscated and never returned my kirpan.
Since that time, I have stopped wearing the panj kakkars,
so as to blend in with the dominant culture
and to more effectively a wage war of annihilation against the terrorist faction.

After my service to this nation,
the State has refused to compensate me or my family for our sacrifices,
and so the only way I (and some of our other clergy) can afford food, clothes, a terminal for programming or a place to stay,
is by the graciousness of our supporters.

If you choose to make a tax-exempt donation to our organization,
we will send you a receipt for your records,
a personalized thank you letter,
and our personal records showing precisely how we used your donation.

Note: although I was a devout Amritdhari Sikh in my time leading up to my combat experience,
afterward, I opted to take on a more Westernized appearance,
so as to better rally support against the terrorist nation
and to shift to a more war-like variant of the Sanatan Dharma (eternal lifeway),
as Sikhs have lost that naive, too-quick-to-fight nature that made them formidable pre-colonization.
Since that time I have even infiltrated Nazarene factions that support the terrorist nation.

I do still believe that Sikhi is closest in spirit to the Bill of Rights,
but I no longer believe that that spirit is the one we need to invoke,
for this is no longer the post-liberal-monarchy period,
but instead this is the era just before post-civilization.

May the gods be with you,
Zantetsoth
