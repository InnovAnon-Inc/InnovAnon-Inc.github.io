Without the Shell:

Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites.
The egg whites will make omelettes,
and the yolks are the base for the sauce.

Omelettes:
- egg whites
- flour or pancake mix
- milk or cream
- turmeric and paprika to restore egg-y color
- salt (use less salt if using more cheese)
- fry these like fried eggs, causing caramelized brown spots on the omelette
- if using a less-sticky pan, before flipping, sprinkle with cheese, then burn the cheese
- if using a more-sticky pan, after  flipping, sprinkle with cheese, then melt the cheese

Hollandaise Sauce:
- up to one stick of butter per egg yolk
- some milk or cream makes this reaction less delicate
- add heat and a splash of acid (usually lemon juice or vinegar)
- add more heat until emulsified.
  too hot or too long will curdle the eggs and de-emulsify the fats.
- add salt and herbs.



With the Shell:

- soak whole egg in vinegar for 1-2 days
- cook in slow cooker, ~1? hour for "warm" setting
