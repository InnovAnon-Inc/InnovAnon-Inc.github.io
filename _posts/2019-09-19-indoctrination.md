NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



Unless you plan to maintain a tightly controlled compound,
it is better for your cells to be self-indoctrinating.

Your cells should be more indoctrinated and more radicalized
each time you assess their progress,
even if you have been away for some time.



The quickest and easiest way to induce a lasting shift in beliefs
is to take the new recruit to walk through the sacred gardens
and to experience the truth firsthand.

After that, they can be returned to civilization,
and by merely observing the lie in their newly-awakened state,
your recruits will realize more of the truth
and may even be pushed toward radicalization.



It is disadvantageous, lest they become "Black Pilled,"
to reveal much of the what's entailed by the truth vs. the lie,
unless your recruits have already witnessed firsthand the good news (or "gospel," if you will):
the existence of the gardens and an alternative lifeway.

Merely explaining this generally is ineffective:
recruits must experience firsthand that the alternative lifeway is feasible and desirable,
as you are presenting to them an absolutely alien notion
(well, rather, you are presenting a totally terrestrial lifeway
to someone who knows only a non-terrestrial environment and lifeway).



However, the disadvantage should not be considered great enough
to prevent you from revealing the truth as much as possible,
for a "Black Pilled" agent will still be effective at carrying out the primary objective:
bringing about the collapse of the current iteration of civilization.
