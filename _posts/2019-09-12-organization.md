NOTICE! Everything herein is presented purely as purely hypothetical--a work of fiction.



The back-end needs to consist of specialized cells.
All sensitive operations need to be carried out by this system of specialized cells.



A cell consists of one or more individuals (agents).
This is the smallest unit of division within the organization.
With proper encapsulation and division of labor,
one-time and recurring tasks can be subcontracted to cells which can be simply released from service as a unit.
Within a cell, the standard counter-intelligence risks still apply:
  - sleeper cell
  - defecting
  - interrogation, including hypothetical truth serums
  - polygraph
  - accidentally betraying information to a skilled expression-reader
  - advanced technology or other sorcery
  - etc.
As such, the individual members of a cell probably need to be thoroughly disposed of if they are compromised.

Cells need to be encapsulated from each other:
  - Cells have minimal information about each other,
    specifically the one receiving the message must know and trust the sender's signing key.
  - All communications between cells must be over anonymous channels.
    For emails, the recipient and subject need special attention,
    even if you are encrypting the message body.
    The sender must use something such as MixMaster or ?.
    The receiver is better using an anonymous inbox.

For broadcasting to multiple cells:
  - Use a steganographic tool to embed the encrypted and signed message into an image
    and publish the image.
  - Obviously, the receivers must know to poll that forum for the latest steganographically-embedded broadcasts.

Transmission of non-digital assets, including hardware containing digital assets which requiring physical exchange
(e.g., if OIT policy prevents them from being connected to the internet):
  - These dead drops and pickups can be performed by non-technical field agents.
  - A technical agent will need to prepare the digital assets, including encrypting and cryptographically signing the data.
  - A technical agent will need to decrypt the data and verify the signature(s).



As much as possible, tasks need to be subdivided into "primitive" subtasks
and these subtasks need to be carried out by separate cells.
In literature, we can look to emulate the construction of the submarine in 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
A real life example is detailed above:
  - A unit which is authorized to give orders to another unit
    prepares an encrypted and signed USB containing a set of instructions
    and dead drops this USB.
  - A non-technical unit dead pickups the USB,
    and places the device into the cargo of an innocuous front-end operation (possibly an unrelated, unsuspecting third party).
  - The front-end operation transports the USB some distance.
  - Another non-technical unit dead pickups the USB which was stashed in the innocuous cargo
    and dead drops this USB.
  - The unit receiving orders can now dead pickup the USB,
    decrypt the data and verify the signature.

To continue that example:
  - Having received the orders, which hypothetically contain instructions to:
      - source a burner laptop
      - install and configure the specified system
      - place the laptop in a tamper-resistant or tamper-evident encasing.
      - dead drop the laptop
  - Another unit receives instructions to:
      - dead pickup a burner laptop
      - verify the integrity of the tamper-resistant/evident encasing
      - use it to anonymously source supplies and materials
      - dead drop those supplies and materials at one location
      - place the laptop in a tamper-resistant or tamper-evident encasing.
      - dead drop the burner laptop at another location
  - Yet another unit receives instructions to:
      - dead pick up the burner laptop
      - verify the integrity of the tamper-resistant/evident encasing
      - wipe the hard disk if necessary
      - liquidate the device or schedule it for reuse
  - Still yet another unit receives instructions to:
      - dead pick up aforementioned supplies and materials
      - the proverbial "Step 3: Profit!"
        (probably something involving retail)



The front-end(s) have less rigid requirements,
however they are limited to innocuous activities--the motto here is,
"We meet for cupcakes and cookies."

The front-ends can serve as a way to recruit agents for the back-end,
but newly-onboarded members of the back-end should subsequently distance themselves from front-end operations.

Front-end operations can serve as a host on which some back-end operations can piggyback.

Having multiple front-ends requires more overhead and may suffer some amount of redundancy,
but it helps to broaden your organization's ability to start building a rapport with potential back-end recruits.



Long-lived cells should probably have some enduring reason to remain in faithful service to your organization's backend.
This is probably best done by indoctrinating them to have shared ideologies and end-goals.
For such a cell, the members should probably be recruited from the same front-end.

Short-lived cells that don't require long-lasting cohesion can be approached differently.
Their members can be recruited from different front-ends,
leveraging each member's existing dogma
and aligning their current goals with one of your back-end's primitive sub tasks.
This is the ecuminical, religiously radicalized equivalent of a multidisciplinary study.



When sourcing agents for either type of cell,
there are attributes which can increase the likelihood of a potential recruit joining:
  - socially-isolated individuals--providing a sense of family can go a very long way
  - disenfranchised members of society,
    including the hungry, homeless, unemployable, etc.
  - people in particularly stressful or emergent circumstances,
    such as divorce, losing a job, eviction, terminal illness, suicidalism, etc.
  - people who are already radicalized (i.e., zealously believe) in a particular dogma,
    including religious or political doctrines
  - idiots who glorify being cannon-fodder
